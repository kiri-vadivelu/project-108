## Our Statement

The land I am standing on today is the traditional territory of many nations
including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the
Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples and is now home to many diverse First
Nations, Inuit and MeÃÅtis peoples. I also acknowledge that Toronto is covered
by Treaty 13 signed with the Mississaugas of the Credit, and the Williams
Treaties signed with multiple Mississaugas and Chippewa bands.

### Your Participation

Using and participating in a land acknowledgement is a way to recognize the
enduring presence and resilience of Indigenous peoples in this area for time
immemorial. They are also a reminder that we are all accountable to these
relationships.

Thereby, I dedicate all journal entries to my daughter Katherine and every
child that never returned home from residential schools in Canada through 1830
to 1996.
