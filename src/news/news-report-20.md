Supporters of the Municipal Socialist Alliance distributed hundreds of pieces of literature to transit riders outside a busy subway station on a sunny Tuesday afternoon. The message "Free Public Transit. Remove the Turnstiles" was well received by residents of the area, several of whom stopped to chat with Ward 14 Toronto-Danforth MSA candidate Wali Abro, and to sign up for more campaign information.

While the advance polls are open now, voting culminates on Monday, October 24. On Election Night, MSA activists and friends will gather at The Imperial Pub, 44 Dundas Street East, second floor, to watch the results on TV and toast the emergence of a revolutionary urban movement that is destined to continue.

People are also invited to join MSA candidate Adam Golding at the Painted lady on Monday, October 24 for a #evictjohntory musical performance.
