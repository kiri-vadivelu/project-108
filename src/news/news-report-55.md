Socialism is a populist economic and political system based on collective, common, or public ownership of the means of production.

Capitalists have championed as defenders of private property; however, the opposite is true. Under capitalism, the law of evictions and seizes of personal properties are enforced by the government whereas in socialism no such laws.

For the past 500 years, capitalism thrived on war driven economy to make rich richer while poor poorer. In the most richest country America, people cannot own homes or earn enough to live with dignity.

The exponential rise of subscriptions business model in capitalism reinforce the reality that under capitalism people will own nothing. However, free market advocates continue to fool the masses with the private property ownership and rights.

Socialists contend that shared ownership of resources and central planning provide a more equal distribution of goods and services and a more equitable society. Capitalism, with its belief in private ownership and the goal to maximize profits, stands in contrast to socialism.

While socialism calls for collective or shared ownership of the means of production, it does not imply that there is no private ownership of personal property. Thus, corporations and factories would be shared among the members of society, but individuals and households would still own their own personal effects.

An individual owning a house is considered personal property and have nothing to do with private ownership. An example of private ownership is one individual owning a garment factory where all the profits are absorbed using the labour without compensating fairly to workers and the environment. Socialists wants ownership of labour in harmony with nature which capitalists exploit for profit.

Socialist ideals include production for use, rather than for profit; an equitable distribution of wealth and material resources among all people; no more competitive buying and selling in the market and free access to goods and services without producing excessive waste or hoarding of resources or monopoly of basic necessities.

Socialism as a system of shared resources and collective production dates back to the earliest human civilizations. Tribal or clan-based societies would often work for the common good and work together to produce enough food and supplies for the entire population. Collective agriculture persisted for thousands of years. This was replaced in many places by some sort of feudal system, whereby landed nobility (lords) ruled over peasants (serfs) who worked the land without owning it.

Following the failure of socialist central planning in the former Soviet Union and Maoist China during the 20th century, many modern socialists adjusted to a high regulatory and redistributive system sometimes referred to as market socialism or democratic socialism. Functionally, socialism and free-market capitalism are often divided on two core issues: property rights and control of production.

In a capitalist economy, private individuals and enterprises own the means of production and have the right to profit from them; private property rights are taken very seriously and apply to nearly everything.

In a purely socialist economy, the collective owns and controls the means of production; personal property is allowed, but in the form of consumer goods. Essential services like healthcare, education, and public transportation are administered for free by the government and funded through taxation instead of military complex.

Thats why socialism is so awesome and worth overcoming fear and hate implanted by crooked capitalists to control workers, economy and the nature.
