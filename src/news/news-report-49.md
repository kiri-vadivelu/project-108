For 75+ years, the Palestinian people have been struggling against and resisting Israeli settler colonialism. On this day, Socialist Action in Toronto honour the resistance of the Palestinian people in the face of oppression and dispossession!

In 1948, Israeli militias invaded Palestinian villages and forced over 75% of the native Palestinian population out of their homes and off their land.

The Nakba has continued every day since then. The Nakba is an ongoing settler colonial project that expands daily through continuous home demolitions, settlements, imprisonment, displacement, and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. However, the Palestinian people continue to resist, and will do so until liberation.

Socialist Action is committed to supporting the growth of powerful grassroots Palestinian organizations, reminding us that we all have a role to play in the Palestinian liberation movement.

This weekend, members of Socialist Action together with thousands of activists participated in powerful demonstrations and events across the country.

Join Socialist Action in highlighting the role that the U.S. plays in arming the continuing  Nakba through U.S. military funding to Israel.

Socialist Action stands in solidarity with the oppressed and exploited everywhere, Palestine community is one of the many united fronts united in principle to the struggles of working class liberation.
