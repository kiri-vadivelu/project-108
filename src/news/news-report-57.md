Traffic fatalities are on the rise, advanced technologies are not helpful and Toronto cannot afford road repairs but progressive punishment model is a win win solution. Exclusive program offered by Municipal Socialist Alliance candidate for mayor Kiri Vadivelu.

The number of motor vehicles registered in Canada exceeded 26 million in 2021. Economic losses caused by traffic collision-related health care costs and lost productivity are at least $10 billion annually. In recent years, speeding and aggressive driving deaths reached a decade-high in Ontario. With over 7,200 crashes involving commercial motor vehicles, 81 people tragically lost their lives in speed-related fatalities — a total of 315 people died on Ontario roads in 2021.

Although law enforcement services are equipped with the most advanced technology such as radar and red light cameras in most parts of the province to enforce traffic laws, none are proving to be very helpful. Imposing the same fine for the same infraction is not decreasing traffic incidents, while the cost of maintaining city roads and services rapidly escalates.

The general rise of fines and penalties has hurt the economically underprivileged most cruelly. Penalties for traffic infractions should consider the economic status, the ability to pay, of the convicted person. A progressive penalty model which involves calculating disposable income would be a more equitable deterrent to speeding.

But a free, quality public rapid transit system, funded by taxing the owners of huge properties much more, and de-funding the police, would reduce the number of private motor vehicles on the roads along with related accidents, injuries and fatalities.
