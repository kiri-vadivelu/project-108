The first vape store in Canada opened in 2012. According to Boris Giller, CEO of 180 Vape stores in Toronto, “There were only four vape stores in Toronto when we opened our flagship location in the Bloor and Yonge area in 2014. Now, you see stores opening everywhere because there are so many people looking for vape products.”

However, increasing of vape stores could attract youth under 19 years old, who buy vapes through adults, this should be controlled by increased proper regulations and education.

View the following prohibitions outlined in the Smoke-free Ontario Act:

1. Smoking tobacco and cannabis or use an electronic cigarette (vape) in public places
