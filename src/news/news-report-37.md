Socialist Action is a nationwide party made up of activists committed to the emancipa- tion of workers and the oppressed. We work to revitalize the anti-war, labor, anti-racist, feminist, student and other social movements, and build a revolutionary workers’ party deeply integrated into all the struggles of working people, that can successfully chal- lenge the wealthy elite.

Socialism is the only way to build a truly democratic society organized for the needs of the many, not the profits of the few.

We believe that the world is divided into opposing social classes, and that the main dri- ving force of modern history is the struggle between the working class and the capitalist class. We believe in independent working class politics – not alliances with the capital- ists, or any wing of the capitalist class. That is why we call for workers to break with the Democratic Party to build a party of the working class. To do that, we work to raise the class-consciousness of workers and their awareness of the class struggle in society. The interests of the working class are diametrically opposed to those of the capitalists.
