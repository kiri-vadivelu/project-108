When is Justice a-gonna be our home—
Where there is a ground floor of Love,
Where there are four walls of Care,
Where the roof is a skylight of Insight?

I want Justice to always be our home.
I want to open a door and find Love.
Up from the basement, rises Warmth!
And from every wall my family beams.

I want Justice to always have a home
In my heart, to chamber close to Love.
I want to lounge and be surrounded by faces
Painted, pictured, or framed, but alive!

Where there is Justice, there is a home!
A table is set there with wine and bread,
Milk and honey, loaves and fishes,
Plus donairs and donuts, coffee and tea.

When I sit to feast, my enemies vanish.
I shelter within four walls of Care.
Sunlight smiles right bright through the skylight.
Outdoors, the garden is also a playground.

We need Justice to be a Home!
We need to stand on a ground floor of Love!
We need four walls as mighty as muscle!
We need to look up and see the sun all gold.

Outdoors, the garden is a Kindergarten;
And all God’s children are at home with Love.
Home is a cradle, a table, a bath, and a bed—
And a court where Love is the sentence said.

We say Justice is a-gonna be our home—
Where there is a ground floor of Love,
Where there are four walls of Care,
Where the roof is a skylight of Insight!
