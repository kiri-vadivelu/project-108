Since first identifying homelessness as a social problem in the 1980s, Finland had already succeeded in reducing total homelessness to very low levels by 2008; however, long-term homelessness, often experienced by people with high rates of severe mental illness, comorbidity of drug and alcohol use and poor physical health, formed a high proportion of the residual homeless population.

Paavo I and Paavo II were therefore specifically targeted at long-term homelessness and included a sometimes controversial use of the Housing First approach. Alongside the focus on bringing down long-term homelessness, the Paavo II program accelerated the national movement towards an integrated homelessness strategy, including increased preventative services and a greater emphasis on tackling concealed homelessness.

The chapter describes the strategy, the context in which it arose, the successes that have been achieved and the challenges that still face Finland.
