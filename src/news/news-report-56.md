The brutal enslavement of millions of Africans was not only a moral travesty but a foundational pillar of the American economy and society. From the exploitation of labor to the violent coercion of human beings, the legacy of slavery continues to reverberate through American history.

Black Americans continue to experience the intergenerational trauma wrought by centuries of slavery, segregation, and state-sponsored violence. From economic inequality to police brutality, the aftermath of this brutal history is visible in every aspect of Black life.

The legacy of slavery is nothing less than a national crisis that demands our immediate attention and action. The ongoing harm inflicted on Black Americans threatens the very foundations of our democracy and our shared humanity.

For our society to truly reckon with the sins of the past, we must commit to real change. This means acknowledging the ongoing harm inflicted upon Black Americans, dismantling systemic inequality and white supremacy, and investing in policies that promote justice and equity for all.

If you agree, join Municipal Socialist Alliance to make that a reality in Canada. Together we can advance the goal of peace through social justice, unity through mutual solidarity, and the socialist transformation of society. Vote one and only class conscious leader, Kiri Vadivelu for Mayor in Toronto on June 26!
