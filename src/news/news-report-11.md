Without evidence and reasoning, nothing would make sense. Here is my reasoning as to why I chose socialism over barbarism.

<!-- excerpt -->

As we come out of the long pandemic, Toronto still have no plans in place to address the needs of working, young and the vulnerable in the city. Our wages shrink with inflation, expenses skyrocket and we eat less but that is not a concern for status quo servants. In a social condition where people die without adequate care in our streets, non-partisan means pro-establishment.

From Toronto to Ottawa, civil liberty and justice have been compromised like never before in history. City of Toronto elegantly criminalized poverty through evicting houseless people while Ottawa struck peaceful protesters with iron fist for resisting vaccine mandates. COVID 2020 reminded that capitalism cannot be reformed but we can ourselves. That is why I stand to challenge the status quo.

We, as individuals may have different opinions and views; however, we are the 99 percent and share the common goals. The 1 percent who owns everything do not live with us but continue to dictate city hall politics. We must unite to stop the tyranny, hate and division from mocking our democracy. Like the majority, my faith in our electoral system is low since that only works for the few. It reveals the fact that our democracy have been exploited by the corporate crooks for long time.

The status quo leaders are corporate welfare bums rotating turns to serve the interest of liberal bourgeois. Therefore, I decided to run for Mayor of Toronto to represent workers. We, workers make the city run; therefore, workers should run the city, not the bosses. I am determined to break every wall that prevents working people from achieving their full potential in the city.

As a one and only socialist candidate, I believe that grassroots movements lead by collective actions can restore democracy, peace and justice for all. For those reasons, I will be knocking on doors, dropping flyers and meeting people across the city along with volunteers of Municipal Socialist Alliance (MSA). Together, we can change the culture of city hall from oppression and exploitation to true democracy and representation.

Unseat the greed, restore justice and prosper socially and economically in harmony with nature. Thats how we build a sustainable future for everyone. The proof is in the program and the real change begins with you. Let us choose socialism over barbarism on June 26.

In Solidarity, Kiri Vadivelu
