## A Little About Me

As a social justice activist, I am running with the MSA for the seat in [Scarborough](https://kiri-vadivelu.ca/blog/article-0/) Centre [Ward 21](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/neighbourhoods-communities/ward-profiles/ward-21-scarborough-centre/). An ethnicity of [Tamil](https://www.tamilcentre.ca/en/about/background) minority immigrated from [Sri Lanka](https://github.com/kiri-vadivelu/project-108/blob/main/src/tamil-genocide.pdf) in childhood, successfully resisted illegal eviction of my family at Ontario Landlord [Tribunal](https://tribunalsontario.ca/ltb/) during the 2020 [emergency](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/covid.html) lock down.

Since then, I passionately strive to make housing a human right in [Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/page/home-and-community). A founding member of the Scarborough Tenantsâ€™ [Union](https://scarboroughtenants.ca), leading voice of Toronto [ACORN](https://acorncanada.org) and committed member of [Justice](https://www.justice4workers.org) for Workers. Once trained shop steward of the United Steelworkers Union [USW](https://usw.ca) where I fought for better working conditions, and was recipient of a 2019 leadership award from USW [headquarters](http://spt-usw.org/about-us/headquarters/) in Pittsburgh, United States.

Accomplished Bachelors of Arts (BA) in [Criminology](https://ontariotechu.ca/programs/undergraduate/social-science-and-humanities/criminology-and-justice/), Justice and Policy Studies at the [University](https://ontariotechu.ca) of Ontario; meanwhile celebrating 20 years of residence in Scarborough.

While we all agree that status quo can no longer serve the needs of our [communities](https://github.com/kiri-vadivelu/project-108/blob/main/src/peoples-platform.pdf), we can still have different point of views on different social issues. That is what makes us unique and stronger at the same time.

For instance, when I was fighting against a corporate landlord in the midst of a pandemic, my [community](https://tdotcommunity.ca/project/guarding-his-home/) came together to protect my family. It was people's defense that lead to my ultimate victory. Therefore, I can assure that we will at least agree of somethings that will help us move forward in the great social, economical and political transformation in history.

Please note that only residents of Scarborough [Center](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/8f47-City_Planning_2016_Census_Profile_2018_25Wards_Ward21.pdf), Ward 21 can vote to elect People's [Platform](https://kiri-vadivelu.ca/elect); however, anyone can help contribute to the good work through sharing and encouraging more people to vote in the upcoming municipal election. Please use the environment friendly posters at your discretion, [poster 8x11](https://github.com/kiri-vadivelu/project-108/blob/main/src/8x11.pdf), [Poster 4x5](https://github.com/kiri-vadivelu/project-108/blob/main/src/4x5.pdf). If you need printed copies, kindly send an email and someone will deliver to you.
