<h1>Ward 21 News</h1>
<time datetime="2022-10-10"> October 10, 2022 </time>

<p>Dear Friends and Comrades:</p>
<p>
  I am fighting a toughest fight in Scarborough Ward 21 against an incumbent
  politician who has been destroying our city for 16 years in exchange for
  corporate donuts and tax payer vacations. Your support could be the tie
  breaker.
</p>
<p>
  If you live in my ward 21, please remember to exercise your democratic right
  by voting on or before 24. Visit https://toronto.ca/city-government/elections
  for more information, email kiri@scarboroughtenants.ca or call 311 for help.
  If you live outside of Ward 21, kindly re-share, re-tweet or create a post to
  keep the information flow.
</p>
<p>
  If someone ask question that you already know the answer on my platform or
  anywhere, kindly answer and help out. If you have time to canvass with me,
  please do, I am going out everyday till Oct 24 along with STU.
</p>
<p>
  My primary campaign is word of mouth and environment friendly flyers only. I
  do not ask for donation and I do not have any corporate funding either but if
  you can, you know what to do. Let us put Scarborough on the map by changing
  the status quo.
</p>
<p>People united can never be defeated. Happy Thanksgiving 2022.</p>
