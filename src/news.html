<h3>Busted Back Door at 6 Glamorgan</h3>
<p>
  Had no trouble entering 7 Glamorgan Ave. as the back door has been busted and
  remained ajar. A tenant who live at the apartment for three yrs said “Its
  always been that way”. Not only I was shocked at her normalization of the
  condition but my mind started racing in outrage.
</p>
<p>
  I was going to ask, "Do you pay rent to live in the building?" but politely
  expressed my disappointment with tied lips and continued the canvassing. Why
  do corporate slumlords collect rent anyway?

<h3>Corporate Greed at 879 Kennedy Rd</h3>
<p>
  A self identified superintendent at 879 Kennedy Road tried to pull a string
  that I did not identify properly while holding my literature in her hand
  reading “Housing is a human right”. After back and forth conversation about
  legal requirements, she complied with the election law once convinced that I
  am not accepting any form of barrier to democracy. It is obvious that keeping
  tenants poorly informed benefit the landlord; therefore, it is the best
  interest of corporate personals to place a barrier instead of bridge.

<h3>Memorial for 17 yr old at 31 Gilder</h3>
<p>
  At 31 Gilder Dr. TCHC, spoke to Shermi in front of memorial set for 17 yr old
  who got shot and died few days ago. She said something got to change, I am
  worried, I explained the socialist solutions from People's Platform, she
  agreed and said “I never thought that way”. De-fund police, fund schools.
</p>
<p>
  Violence cannot be stopped with more violence but why government fund police
  anyways? Police is necessary to protect the rich and the ruling class and
  therefore, all solutions will be increase police budget instead of actually
  solving social problem that leads to violence in the first place.
</p>
<p>
  Had the 17 year old victim and the 16 year old shooter were involved in an
  extra curricular activity afterschool, chances are the lives could have been
  saved. Now, our community lost two young people. One lost forever, while,
  another being locked up in prison using tax payer dollars.

<h3>TCHC Nightmare at 400 McCowan</h3>
<p>
  Another city owned property at 400 Mccowan Road, Toronto Community Housing
  Corporation (TCHC) staff granted access with hesitance. Later asked, if my
  election materials end up in hallway, can he send the invoice to me? Not only
  degrading but disgraceful attitude toward democracy.
</p>
<p>
  I am starting to feel as TCHC as modernized prison system for the poor.
  Residence of TCHC are over policed and treated as criminals till proven
  innocent; including those who care to change the system. Clearly, Toronto is
  divided between the rich and poor. TCHC is not only the worst landlord in the
  city but exposes itself as the most disrespectful workplace culture.

<h3>Positive Campaign Moments at Bendale</h3>
<p>
  Instead of denying access and calling 911 to boot me out of the building,
  Bendale Acres Longterm Care staff at 2920 Lawrence Avenue, E. Scarborough,
  respected my time and agreed to resolve the matter right away. They understood
  that reasonable access does not mean come back tomorrow or book an appointment
  to canvass the residence; which would be a denial of democracy to vulnerable
  people at the care home.
</p>
<p>
  Due to COVID outbreak at the location, some floors were not accessible and we
  agreed mutually for better a alternative outcome. It felt so liberating to
  speak to staff that understood the value of our democracy and basic human
  decency. And, our candidate support line was awesome and waited with me on the
  line, the whole time.

<h3>Endorsement from Acorn Canada</h3>
<p>
  From the time, I received eviction notice in the middle of a pandemic till my
  victory at the Ontario Landlord Tenant Board, Toronto ACORN was with me. When
  it comes to fighting for social and economical justice, ACORN members are
  unsung heroes. Joining ACORN members to fight for justice in my community, was
  the most eye opening experience for me. Today, I am humbled for their
  endorsement to Ward 21 Council to elevate the fight for social and economical
  justice at Toronto City Hall.

<h3>Denied Access to Birkdale Shelter</h3>
<p>
  Do not deny the democratic rights of people with your creepy laws. I was
  denied entry to 1229 Ellesmere Road, Birkdale Residence in my Ward 21 from
  canvassing, a shelter run by the city. If you do not want to listen to people,
  thats ok but do not prevent me.
</p>
<p>
  After realizing, Birkdale Shelter made terrible mistake by denying me access
  to speak to residents, the following day response, apparently city did not
  deny access but I did not make an appointment. Truth is that our city is being
  run by psychopaths.

<h3>The Print Shop Delivered on Promise</h3>
<p>
  The local print shop Copy Place always been the most dependable print service
  provider. Not only delivers on time but also catches mistakes before printing.
  Although local businesses have been exploited by the big corporations, the
  service of small business and connection to the community is unmatchable. The
  big run began with 10,000 copies.

<h3>First Day of Door Knocking with Prints</h3>
<p>
  As they say, charity starts at home. 945 residents received the flyers first,
  STU team was excited and made some noise in the street. Received mostly
  positive feedbacks from neighbors. Some asked to make full color but we
  explained the reasoning, they loved it. About 500 flyers STU delivered in the
  area.

<h3>Environment Friendly, Campaign Flyers</h3>
<p>
  Completed environment friendly campaign flyer design. The versions, half size
  4*5 is reserved for door knocking and the 8*11 for streets. Since color ink
  does more harm to environment, only used black and white. Meanwhile, thick
  cards cause safety concerns such as slip and falls, research team recommended
  plain paper.
</p>
<p>
  Our company is named Digital Designers, we have nothing to do with graphic
  design these days. The reason we still carry the name is because we grew up
  with the name and we do not want to change now. The company website has been
  crying out-loud for update but I doubt we can anytime soon.

<h3>Campaign Website Launch at STU</h3>
<p>
  After weeks of planning, coding and testing, the campaign website is finally
  launched successfully. The most advanced static technology was implemented and
  the workflow is to be adapted into future web projects. My love for sass, 11ty
  and Github was a perfect marriage that I could only dream of. Trying not to
  think of bug fixes, that would be a party flopper.
