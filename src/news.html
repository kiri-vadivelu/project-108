  History, Municipal Socialist Alliance, Socialist Action, Stop the Split and to

<h3>Beautiful Street Postering Day</h3>
<p>
  The weather was cool, light was bright and interacted with multiple happy
  faces. I think the weather plays a huge role on our mood and thoughts. Most
  would agree that North Americans need more sun light to go through the moody
  blue days.
</p>

<p>
  Coincidentally, I ran into my competitor and incumbent Michael Thompson near
  Pharmacy and Lawrence area in Ward 21. Him and his team was campaigning hard
  not to be defeated. In my head "Dude, you had 16 years to do that". Of course,
  I tweeted that because contingents deserve to know everything.
</p>

<h3>Day Off Campaigns for Office Work</h3>
<p>
  Officially completed the outdoor campaign work, might be visiting few indoor
  locations but none confirmed yet. Updated the website, fixed few content
  errors, made minor revision to presentation layer while keeping social media
  up to date. Launched few soft attacks on Twitter to eliminate pseudo democracy
  conversations and fake liberal politics.
</p>

<p>
  I think MSA have outperformed at all levels to tear apart the fake democracy
  and inject real conversation while tapping untapped voter resources. Victory
  on the election is just an icing on the cake. Looking forward to vote for
  myself, yeah really. Why does it feel like Kanye West when I say that?
</p>

<h3>Changing Gears, Started Street Postering</h3>
<p>
  Again, Uncooperative weather but continued the street postering as planned.
  About 25 posters went up at randomly chosen locations in Ward 21. Mostly
  greeted by the people while stared by a few. Blistering cold wind prevented in
  person conversations and kept everyone moving faster along the side walks.
</p>
<p>
  For the first time, I started feeling somewhat anxious about the election as I
  was sipping the warm tea. Shamelessly, checked out on the competitive
  candidates on their activity. Strangely, I did not find much except the
  incumbent photo ups. Then I wondered, why would an incumbent who had in the
  same role for 16 years even need to campaign?
</p>

<h3>Wet, Chilly and Slow Campaign Day</h3>
<p>
  Casual conversations and greetings with the few who opened their doors.
  Uncooperative weather kept most people indoors and possibly low mood for an
  political conversation. Ended the day with only 3 hours in the field of
  knocking doors and literature distributions.
</p>
<p>
  Later, Sat down at Tim Horton with hot coffee and wrote an article titled "In
  Politics, Elect Policy; Not Personality". That made me feel somewhat
  productive on a dull campaign day.
</p>

<h3>City of Toronto Appreciation 'Thanks to Educators'</h3>
<p>
  City tweeted "Thank you, Child Care Workers, Early Childhood Educators! You
  are always there for our children, our families. We commend you today and
  everyday"
</p>
<p>
  My response, "Let us translate words into action. Repair schools, reduce class
  sizes and provide more funding for extra curricular activities to keep kids
  off the street."
</p>

<p>
  Of course, city did not respond. Nearly all with excessive wealth and power do
  not send their kids to public schools; therefore, de-funding schools do not
  affect the wealthy or powerful in the city.
</p>

<h3>Property Manager Denied Entry to 12 Craigton</h3>
<p>
  Property manager from Hannah Group at 12 Craigton Dr. denied entry to the
  apartment building housing about 25 residences. The denial was illegal in the
  first place; and was unable to have any reasonable level of conversation with
  the individual. The possible reasoning may be impaired due to drug use or
  intoxication on unknown substance during business hours.
</p>
<p>
  The individual agreed that he collects rent from residences but claims he has
  no responsibility to provide any type of access to anyone to the building. He
  said, "I do not know you, you did not book an appointment to visit any
  apartment and not interested in hearing what you have to say".
</p>
<p>
  After the call was terminated, I noticed human rights notices posted at the
  lobby, indicating that the property management have violated provincial
  housing laws in the past.
</p>

<h3>Busted Back Door at 6 Glamorgan</h3>
<p>
  Had no trouble entering 7 Glamorgan Ave. as the back door has been busted and
  remained ajar. A tenant who live at the apartment for three yrs said “Its
  always been that way”. Not only I was shocked at her normalization of the
  condition but my mind started racing in outrage.
</p>
<p>
  I was going to ask, "Do you pay rent to live in the building?" but politely
  expressed my disappointment with tied lips and continued the canvassing. Why
  do corporate slumlords collect rent anyway?
</p>

<h3>Corporate Greed at 879 Kennedy Rd</h3>
<p>
  A self identified superintendent at 879 Kennedy Road tried to pull a string
  that I did not identify properly while holding my literature in her hand
  reading “Housing is a human right”. After back and forth conversation about
  legal requirements, she complied with the election law once convinced that I
  am not accepting any form of barrier to democracy. It is obvious that keeping
  tenants poorly informed benefit the landlord; therefore, it is the best
  interest of corporate personals to place a barrier instead of bridge.
</p>

<h3>Memorial for 17 yr old at 31 Gilder</h3>
<p>
  At 31 Gilder Dr. TCHC, spoke to Shermi in front of memorial set for 17 yr old
  who got shot and died few days ago. She said something got to change, I am
  worried, I explained the socialist solutions from People's Platform, she
  agreed and said “I never thought that way”. De-fund police, fund schools.
</p>
<p>
  Violence cannot be stopped with more violence but why government fund police
  anyways? Police is necessary to protect the rich and the ruling class and
  therefore, all solutions will be increase police budget instead of actually
  solving social problem that leads to violence in the first place.
</p>
<p>
  Had the 17 year old victim and the 16 year old shooter were involved in an
  extra curricular activity afterschool, chances are the lives could have been
  saved. Now, our community lost two young people. One lost forever, while,
  another being locked up in prison using tax payer dollars.
</p>

<h3>TCHC Nightmare at 400 McCowan</h3>
<p>
  Another city owned property at 400 Mccowan Road, Toronto Community Housing
  Corporation (TCHC) staff granted access with hesitance. Later asked, if my
  election materials end up in hallway, can he send the invoice to me? Not only
  degrading but disgraceful attitude toward democracy.
</p>
<p>
  I am starting to feel as TCHC as modernized prison system for the poor.
  Residence of TCHC are over policed and treated as criminals till proven
  innocent; including those who care to change the system. Clearly, Toronto is
  divided between the rich and poor. TCHC is not only the worst landlord in the
  city but exposes itself as the most disrespectful workplace culture.
</p>

<h3>Positive Campaign Moments at Bendale</h3>
<p>
  Instead of denying access and calling 911 to boot me out of the building,
  Bendale Acres Longterm Care staff at 2920 Lawrence Avenue, E. Scarborough,
  respected my time and agreed to resolve the matter right away. They understood
  that reasonable access does not mean come back tomorrow or book an appointment
  to canvass the residence; which would be a denial of democracy to vulnerable
  people at the care home.
</p>
<p>
  Due to COVID outbreak at the location, some floors were not accessible and we
  agreed mutually for better a alternative outcome. It felt so liberating to
  speak to staff that understood the value of our democracy and basic human
  decency. And, our candidate support line was awesome and waited with me on the
  line, the whole time.
</p>

<h3>Endorsement from Acorn Canada</h3>
<p>
  From the time, I received eviction notice in the middle of a pandemic till my
  victory at the Ontario Landlord Tenant Board, Toronto ACORN was with me. When
  it comes to fighting for social and economical justice, ACORN members are
  unsung heroes. Joining ACORN members to fight for justice in my community, was
  the most eye opening experience for me. Today, I am humbled for their
  endorsement to Ward 21 Council to elevate the fight for social and economical
  justice at Toronto City Hall.
</p>

<h3>Dear Friends and Comrades</h3>
<p>
  I am fighting a toughest fight in Scarborough Ward 21 against an incumbent
  politician who has been destroying our city for 16 years in exchange for
  corporate donuts and tax payer vacations. Your support could be the tie
  breaker.
</p>
<p>
  If you live in my ward 21, please remember to exercise your democratic right
  by voting on or before 24. Visit https://toronto.ca/city-government/elections
  for more information, email kiri@scarboroughtenants.ca or call 311 for help.
  If you live outside of Ward 21, kindly re-share, re-tweet or create a post to
  keep the information flow.
</p>
<p>
  If someone ask question that you already know the answer on my platform or
  anywhere, kindly answer and help out. If you have time to canvass with me,
  please do, I am going out everyday till Oct 24 along with STU.
</p>
<p>
  My primary campaign is word of mouth and environment friendly flyers only. I
  do not ask for donation and I do not have any corporate funding either but if
  you can, you know what to do. Let us put Scarborough on the map by changing
  the status quo.
</p>
<p>People united can never be defeated. Happy Thanksgiving 2022.</p>

<h3>Denied Access to Birkdale Shelter</h3>
<p>
  Do not deny the democratic rights of people with your creepy laws. I was
  denied entry to 1229 Ellesmere Road, Birkdale Residence in my Ward 21 from
  canvassing, a shelter run by the city. If you do not want to listen to people,
  thats ok but do not prevent me.
</p>
<p>
  After realizing, Birkdale Shelter made terrible mistake by denying me access
  to speak to residents, the following day response, apparently city did not
  deny access but I did not make an appointment. Truth is that our city is being
  run by psychopaths.

<h3>The Print Shop Delivered on Promise</h3>
<p>
  The local print shop Copy Place always been the most dependable print service
  provider. Not only delivers on time but also catches mistakes before printing.
  Although local businesses have been exploited by the big corporations, the
  service of small business and connection to the community is unmatchable. The
  big run began with 10,000 copies.
</p>

<h3>First Day of Door Knocking with Prints</h3>
<p>
  As they say, charity starts at home. 945 residents received the flyers first,
  STU team was excited and made some noise in the street. Received mostly
  positive feedbacks from neighbors. Some asked to make full color but we
  explained the reasoning, they loved it. About 500 flyers STU delivered in the
  area.
</p>

<hr />
<time datetime="2022-10-06"> October 06, 2022 </time>
<h3>Environment Friendly, Campaign Flyers</h3>
<p>
  Completed environment friendly campaign flyer design. The versions, half size
  4*5 is reserved for door knocking and the 8*11 for streets. Since color ink
  does more harm to environment, only used black and white. Meanwhile, thick
  cards cause safety concerns such as slip and falls, research team recommended
  plain paper.
</p>
<p>
  Our company is named Digital Designers, we have nothing to do with graphic
  design these days. The reason we still carry the name is because we grew up
  with the name and we do not want to change now. The company website has been
  crying out-loud for update but I doubt we can anytime soon.

<h3>Campaign Website Launch at STU</h3>
<p>
  After weeks of planning, coding and testing, the campaign website is finally
  launched successfully. The most advanced static technology was implemented and
  the workflow is to be adapted into future web projects. My love for
  <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>,
  <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> and
  <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> was a perfect marriage that I could
  only dream of. No need to mention that
  <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> is a masterpiece. Trying not to
  think of bug fixes, that would be a party flopper.

<h3>Projects Offloaded, Begun Election Work</h3>
<p>
  Better late than never. Began election work. Meetings, policy debates, content
  preparation, drafting program for Scarborough Ward 21 in accordance with
  Toronto municipality. Reading, writing and less sleeping to keep up with the
  pace of Municipal Socialist Alliance (MSA). The People's Platform is the most
  comprehensive program for Toronto City Council to date; yet, work in the
  progress. Not radical enough to solve all social issues but a good start.

<h3>Nomination Papers for Ward 21 Council</h3>
<p>
  Politics was not a path I ever thought to travel. After being involved in few
  social justice projects in Scarborough, I was dragged into politics out of
  necessity. Those around me repeatedly asked to run in the city election, if I
  really want to make difference in the community. The introvert nature of me
  hesitated but deep inside I truly wanted to pull my community forward.
  Subsequently, participated in the political resolutions with Municipal
  Socialist Alliance, prepared a working draft and then filed my papers.
