<h3>Endorsement from Acorn Canada</h3>
<p>
  From the time, I received eviction notice in the middle of a pandemic till my
  victory at the Ontario Landlord Tenant Board, Toronto ACORN was with me. When
  it comes to fighting for social and economical justice, ACORN members are
  unsung heroes. Joining ACORN members to fight for justice in my community, was
  the most eye opening experience for me. Today, I am humbled for their
  endorsement to Ward 21 Council to elevate the fight for social and economical
  justice at Toronto City Hall. #Ward21 #ScarboroughCentre #TorontoAcorn

<h3>Dear Friends and Comrades</h3>
<p>
  I am fighting a toughest fight in Scarborough Ward 21 against an incumbent
  politician who has been destroying our city for 16 years in exchange for
  corporate donuts and tax payer vacations. Your support could be the tie
  breaker.
</p>
<p>
  If you live in my ward 21, please remember to exercise your democratic right
  by voting on or before 24. Visit https://toronto.ca/city-government/elections
  for more information, email kiri@scarboroughtenants.ca or call 311 for help.
  If you live outside of Ward 21, kindly re-share, re-tweet or create a post to
  keep the information flow.
</p>
<p>
  If someone ask question that you already know the answer on my platform or
  anywhere, kindly answer and help out. If you have time to canvass with me,
  please do, I am going out everyday till Oct 24 along with STU.
</p>
<p>
  My primary campaign is word of mouth and environment friendly flyers only. I
  do not ask for donation and I do not have any corporate funding either but if
  you can, you know what to do. Let us put Scarborough on the map by changing
  the status quo.
</p>
<p>People united can never be defeated. Happy Thanksgiving 2022.</p>

<h3>Denied Access to Birkdale Shelter</h3>
<p>
  Do not deny the democratic rights of people with your creepy laws. I was
  denied entry to 1229 Ellesmere Road, Birkdale Residence in my Ward 21 from
  canvassing, a shelter run by the city. If you do not want to listen to people,
  thats ok but do not prevent me.
</p>
<p>
  After realizing, Birkdale Shelter made terrible mistake by denying me access
  to speak to residents, the following day response, apparently city did not
  deny access but I did not make an appointment. Truth is that our city is being
  run by psychopaths.
