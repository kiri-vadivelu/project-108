    <h2>MSA aims to unite the left</h2>
    <p>
      Members of the Municipal Socialist Alliance (MSA) backed ten local

        <span class="cta">&#9873;</span> As a special guest at a recent
        Municipal Socialist Alliance meeting, I was very impressed with their
        vision, energy and commitment, especially amongst younger people who are
        needed so desperately to keep a community-based advocacy group thriving.
        I applaud the group’s efforts and will continue to support them in any
        way that I can!

      <q>
        <span class="cta">&#9873;</span> While much of the labour leadership
        will throw their support behind status quo candidates in the upcoming
        elections, it is clear that business-as-usual municipal politics isn't
        working for working class people. Enough is enough! Vote for change!
        Vote Socialist! Vote for the Municipal Socialist Alliance!

      <q>
        <span class="cta">&#9873;</span> MSA is a coalition of socialists,
        labour unionists, community organizations and social justice activists
        united to fight for the interests of workers, tenants, women, LGBTQIA2S+
        folks, racialized people, seniors and all who seek a city and world
        without exploitation and oppression. I am proud to show my support for a
        Labour City Hall, for a Workers’ Government at the municipal level.
