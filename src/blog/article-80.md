People agree that democracy is failing is the west without any reservations. But, the reasoning of why decimate the debate even before the start. If one was to ask, do you know your city councillor in your ward or member of parliament? Most voters would respond yes but in reality, voters barely know the candidate name.

It is not the fault of the voters but the status quo system that elegantly tricks the masses through selective bias. Because, politics is a manipulation game, status quo candidates only reveal what they want voters to know in order to get elected; not to serve the needs of the people. Media is just another corporations seek to preserve the status quo that continue to exploit people.

Let us review some Toronto city council candidates who are ignored the mainstream media to preserve the status quo. These are candidates from grass-root movements across Toronto that barely known to the public.

These candidates are not endorsed or backed by any corporations except people's movement such as Municipal Socialist Alliance (MSA). These candidates are visually hidden from public in order to support the status quo candidates.

## Danny Drew, Mayor of Guelph

Danny Drew is a non-binary activist running to be mayor of Guelph. Born and raised in Oshawa, they moved to attend the University of Guelph in 2009, graduating with a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering. Danny worked in a wide range of jobs, always encouraging co-workers to exercise their rights and push for unionization. Currently seeking to win rights for thousands of workers via reclassification, they’ve supported many striking workers on picket lines.

Danny is a steadfast ally of ongoing social justice movements – such as Indigenous Land Back and Black Lives Matter – actively resisting the rising tide of fascism.Their main focus has always been poverty relief; offering labour, organizing capabilities, and vast quantities of recovered supplies for those in need. At the onset of the COVID pandemic Danny co-developed a renter’s union as well as helped to operate a Food Not Bombs project.

In the municipal arena, Danny pledges to fight tooth-and-nail for every possible concession from Capital and its state. That includes a high-powered harm reduction strategy involving: reformed social housing systems and relations, expanded and improved public transit, increased funding for mental health and drug user support programs, worker co-op and community land trust formation and expansion, and a drastically altered and reduced police force.

Danny, as part of the Municipal Socialist Alliance, commits to expose the propaganda that keeps the bourgeoisie in power and the majority oppressed. In other words, a campaign for a Workers’ Government to increase class consciousness, and spur unionization, mutual aid, and local self-organization to enable working people to improve their lives.

## Wali Abro, Toronto Danforth Ward 14

Wali became a Canadian citizen last winter, having immigrated from Pakistan nearly 10 years ago. He subscribed to the clichéd image of Canada: that it was fair, compassionate, and built in partnership with the Indigenous peoples. That image was quickly shattered.

He is an active community volunteer, keeps close to the grassroots, and is a passionate activist for Indigenous rights from Turtle Island to Palestine.

He is taking his fight forward by running, as part of the Municipal Socialist Alliance team, to be Councillor for Ward 14 - Toronto-Danforth on a platform that features immediate housing for people experiencing homelessness or precarious housing; improved public safety by significantly de-funding the police and investing in community well-being; and rebuilding Toronto's infrastructure with climate change and population growth in mind.
