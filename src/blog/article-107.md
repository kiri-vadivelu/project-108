We all know that doing the same thing over and over will not lead to different outcome in life but when it come to politics, we do just that. We keep electing the same political parties to maintain the status quo and then get disappointed of our actions. Our education and healthcare, the most vital services cannot be improved when de-funded; however, we expect to improve nonetheless.

Meanwhile, inequality is directly linked to crime rates but we allow politicians to provide more funding for police to reduce crimes year after year. Well, that is insane. Our logic is reversed, we must over fund healthcare and education in order to improve while de-fund the police to reduce inequality. Of course, candies are easier sell than broccoli. After all, social awareness is the key to change the status quo.
