We must be brave and bold to demand justice. Corporate puppets always find a way to liberalize justice movements, notably Black Lives Matter. Instead of calling out the bread crumbs of slavery, traitors of working class bullied the working class movement. Police are tools of the ruling class to maintain the status quo for the owner class. Regardless of the environment, if diversity, equity and inclusion efforts are separate from the pursuit of justice - do not join.
