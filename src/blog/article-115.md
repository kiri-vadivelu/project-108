The global pandemic comes from capitalism, from its need to exploit nature for profit. It has nothing to do with ethnic origins. Challenge attempts to blame, harass, or cause violence against our Asian community. Confront hatred and all forms of discrimination. Anti-pandemic measures, including mandatory vaccination, are urgently needed. Follow the advice of medical professionals about wearing masks, social distancing, and hand hygiene.

We need to insist that all workers, especially those in front-line health care, are provided with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Ensure that private profit is never put ahead of health and safety concerns. Nationalize private for- profit Long Term Care companies.

The big players in the market controlled who receive vaccines based on the economic interest as opposed to saving lives. Thereby, capitalism proven itself as a death cult that needs to be dismantled to save humanity.
