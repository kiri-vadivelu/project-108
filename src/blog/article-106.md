Instead of throwing around fancy terms, we must stop and define all the buzz words. What is inflation? where does it begin? Is it caused by nature? Who wins and who loses? Answering the four questions would set one on the right path to realize inflation is just an economical gimmick to justify the status quo. The buzz word inflation is political forgery to protect the ruling class.

Big corporations will do anything to sell the myth that inflations occurred by everything except corporate greed. In 1970s, anyone with minimum wage job can buy a house but in 2020, minimum wage earner cannot even afford to rent and eat at the same time. Meanwhile corporate CEO salary went up by over 1000 percentage. The common logic is that money incentivize performance but the same logic do not apply to minimum wage workers. That is the gimmick of status of politics.

Why? The 50 years of corporate greed made few rich and many broke while decimating the public trust in government. Who wins, the ruling class, big corporations and the churches. Who loses, the workers, unions and the vulnerable.
