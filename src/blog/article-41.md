Western media hypocrisy has reached new levels. No one is allowed to speak the truth, if you do, expect to be labelled Russian or communist. It beg the question, what is wrong with Russian or communism? If a communist nation was able to defeat the Hitler Nazis, they must have something better than what capitalism offers.

Instead of being grateful for the sacrifices of great Russian working class soldiers, western media has been building hate and misinformation toward the Russians. While portraying Russians as evils in the Hollywood and video games, US have been committing the worst crimes against humanity in the poorest parts of the world. Apartheid state Israel and US have been killing civilians overseas using advanced military drone system violating every international rule of law.

When a capitalist country such as US uses the word “Democracy, Freedom or Justice” every citizen needs to be outraged. Democracy means elected dictatorship to commit violence. Freedom means social manipulation to feed lies. Justice means legalized cruelty to humanity and our planet. That is how our colonial system works.

Colonial capitalism falls apart when people start to ask questions.
