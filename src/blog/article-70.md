As progress is the real purpose, human rights activists including Malcolm X fought for free speech and to eradicate slavery for the good of humanity. However, Zionist Jews were able to use lies and deception to destroy democracy through creating illegitimate laws to ruin free speech.

The real intent of laws such as anti-semitism is to silence all critiques of anti-Zionism; particularly Palestine people from demanding justice. Since people of Palestine were systematically oppressed without any ability to fightback apartheid regime, all illegitimate laws were passed without push-back in the occupied land.

Without critical perspectives, democracy becomes one sided tyranny. Those with all the wealth and power ultimately control the narrative of the free speech. Sadly, American democracy fell for the Zionist manipulation to enforce illegitimate laws to harm free speech everywhere.

History portrays Adolf Hitler as both good and evil; nonetheless, 21st centurions can safely assume that he must have known something that no knew at the time; just as honorable American President John F. Kennedy did. Unfortunately, eradicating Zionists is the only way to save humanity.
