Life was not fair to workers even before the pandemic. We worked multiple jobs to feed and pay rent so few can get rich when food and shelter was a basic human need. As a frontline employee, I paid my dues while billionaires were going to space and laugh at us on their way back during the lock-down. Our capitalist leaders were protecting the big corporations while people were dying of disease that was manufactured through greed, ignorance and cruelty to humanity.

In 2020, I lost my livelihood and then had my family evicted from home but still going strong to inspire, change and build a better future for next generation. My community guarded me at the most difficult time and now I am privileged to lead the change that we all want to see changed. Join the conversation, let us be the change makers. We can break free from the capitalism induced materialism to build better community and preserve our planet. All workers face the same struggle. Let us walk together.

Contribute to the conversation, be the unicorn in your social circle. We do not have to agree on everything but we got to protect each other from the evils of capitalism, imperialism and colonialism. Be engaged, you are a divine being, that is all what matters.
