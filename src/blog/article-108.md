The faith systems exist to protect the ruling class. Of course, we do not have control over some things in life; however, we do have control over many things including politics. The faith system regardless of religion work together with the ruling powers to justify the status quo and protect the corrupted politics. When corrupted politicians make collective decision to exploit people for profit, churches sell the myth that it is godâ€™s fault.

Indeed, it is the fault of greedy politicians. If there are no faith system in place, people will quickly realize bad politics hurts our society. The truth is that, for the part, our lives are negatively impacted not because of god but because of bad politicians and dishonest faith business. Under all circumstances, if you prefer status quo, go to church, if you prefer solution, go to local politicians office.

In case, if you feel excluded because I only used church as an example, simply replace church with your preferred religious structure.
