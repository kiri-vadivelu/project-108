Of course Canada is in the centre stage in the global media for unpleasant reasons. Most corporate media will do whatever necessary to amplify the freedom convey issues. Those who live outside the Canadian borders believe Canadian truckers are fighting for better employment, wages and benefits but we know that is far from reality.

I do not support liberal nor I voted for them in the last election; however, I do not believe Justin Trudeau is a totalitarian. Yes, he did come out too strong to criticize the protesters who were disconnected from the local community. However, I believe that he has let the protest carry on for far too long before taking any action. Nonetheless, who knew everything would be this way? It is a mess that we all need to learn to live with it.

For instance, all employees are ok with having a totalitarian employer but not ok with government that have different opinions. Liberals are not anti-capitalist government nor care about human right violations in Palestine or other poor countries with socialist views. If we are really concerned citizens, we need to boot capitalism out of the system in order to have a balanced government.

Joe Rogan supports corporate exploitation of labour; therefore, he lacks any credibility to criticize Trudeau as a communist dictator. Even if he does have any, he is absolutely incorrect because the correct classification is Trudeau like any Liberal or Conservative leaders, is a corporate dictator. Sadly, wrong diagnosis does not help prescribe right medicine. In reality, Canadians are victim of social genocide.
