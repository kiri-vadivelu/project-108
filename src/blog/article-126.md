From a philosophical point of view, good things tend to not last very long. It is a blessing and curse at the same time. If the good remains for longer duration, it becomes the norm; therefore, good only last a while. Like the early morning mist that disappears when the sun light appear, good things evaporate before we digest.

On the revolutionary front, people yarn for great leaders but then disappointment follow soon after their departure. For the most part, visionary leaders know that they have very little time to make an impact. Unlike the corporate fat cats in coat suit and tie, civil rights movement leaders as the Great Malcolm X do not expect red carpet gratitude for their work. He dedicated his life to liberate the black people from social slavery while did many good for the benefit of humanity.

The most riskiest work in a capitalist society is community mobilization for the good of humanity. Those leaders do not get rich but often make unimaginable personal sacrifices for the benefit of society we live today. However, wild corporate cats view the great social work as threat to wealthy in society. Capitalism, a product of colonialism, supports military mobilization for war but demonize social unification that benefit workers and the oppressed.

For instance, rapper Tupac Shakur was not a humanitarian but attempted to unite the divided African American people who were subject to systematic poverty in United States. Although, he pursued a risky hiphop lifestyle, he really inspired people using his music for the good of humanity. He shared knowledge and wisdom with intent to make life better for the people in the hood.

Let us examine few lyrics of Tupac that are still relevant today. Those lyrics highlight many social issues that we are up against the system that continue to benefit the few. Normally, I do not like foul language but Tupac is an exception.

### War

“Before we find world peace, we gotta find peace and end the war in the streets.” (‘Ghetto Gospel’ 2004)

### Discrimination

“And since we all came from a woman, got our name from a woman and our game from a woman, I wonder why we take from our women, why we rape our women, do we hate our women?” (‘Keep Ya Head Up’ 1993)

### Slavery

“Only thing they ever did wrong was bein’ born black in this white man’s world.” (‘White Man’z World’, 1996)

### Violence

“Here on Earth, tell me what’s a black life worth? A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts.” (‘I Wonder If Heaven Got a Ghetto’ 1997)

### Racism

“And why the hell am I locked in jail? They let them white boys free, we be shocked as hell.” (‘God Bless The Dead’ 1998)

### Oppression

“They got me trapped, can barely walk the city streets without a cop harasskin’ me, searching me, then askin’ my identity. Hands up, throw me up against the wall, didn’t do a thing at all.” (‘Trapped’ 1991)

### Poverty

"They got money for war, but can't feed the poor”. (‘Keep Ya Head Up’ 1993)

### Injustice

“So we live like caged beasts waitin’ for the day to let the rage free. Still me ’til they kill me.” (‘Holler If Ya Hear Me’ 1993)

After reading Tupac’s lyrics, why would any police force employed by the corporate government would ever want to solve the murder of Rapper Tupac?
