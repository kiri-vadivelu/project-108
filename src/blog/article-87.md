Google Workers Push for Cancellation of Secretive $1.2B Project with Israel - Sep 1, 2022 - A national day of action is planned next Thursday as protests grow against Google's secretive $1.2 billion program known as Project #Nimbus, which will provide advanced #artificialintelligence tools to the Israeli government and military.

We speak with two of the leaders of the protest: Ariel Koren, a former Google employee who says she was pushed out for her activism, as well as Gabriel Schubiner, who currently works at #Google and is an #Alphabet Workers Union organizer. ​​"#Cloudtechnology is extremely powerful, and providing that power to a violent military and to an #apartheid government is not a neutral act," says Schubiner on Project Nimbus. The pair also detail how workers are rising up against what Koren says is Google's "culture of retaliation."
