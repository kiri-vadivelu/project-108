Every Jewish immigrant that enters Israel is unwittingly taking part in a continual referendum on its chances of survival. But many of those who enter Israel also choose to leave it. Nearly, half of those who emigrated in 2003 from the US went back, rare statistics not covered in the mainstream media.

For many of them, involvement in actively subjugating Palestinian refugees in the Occupied Territories and the pressure of living the Zionist ideology every day is just too much. Igor Dzhadan describes his situation simply. He emigrated to Israel in 1990 but returned home in 2001, blaming what he called the country’s “sectarian nature”.

“I feel more comfortable in Russia. My life prospects wouldn’t be worse than in Israel. I didn’t like it. I’m used to operating in an open society where people don’t ask you to what community you belong.”

Apartheid state spends billions on advertisements to attract tourism, investments and return of Jewish people into Israel while confiscating Palestine lands at gun point. Israel bank on the fact that when a lie is told repeatedly people will start to believe it as true. Sadly, that is not the case anymore and we do not live in 1930.

The reasons for Jews leaving Israel is complex. However, most do not agree with the way Israel handling civil disputes and land grabs at gun point. The authoritarian mode of managing disputes have only intensified violence on both sides of Israel and Palestine with no room for justice.

Those who enter Israel with abroad life experience not only disagree with the administration of Israel but leave Israel for the good. The inhuman characteristic of apartheid state that Jewish people do not want to be identified with. Unlike holocaust, acts of terrorism against Palestine women and children is not a pride worth sharing with everyone.

For well informed Jewish people, living abroad is the only means to uphold morals, happiness and balanced view of universe in skewed political and economical conditions.
