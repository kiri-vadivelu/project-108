Unlike the British, American economy strategists also known as Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) have a plan in place. Regardless of the type of political administrations, American economy wheels would only keep rolling in one direction. Elections can change the speed of economy wheels; however, none can change the direction of the journey.

Without surprise, the elections are just ceremonies to make Americans and the people around the world believe in democracy; however, politicians have no real purpose in governance of the country. The obsolete elected politicians are only responsible to sign documents and act as a protective layer for big corporations to mobile wealth upwards without making the greedy hands dirty.

While, CIA went from defending democracy to planting evidence on opponents in order to exercise violence; toilet paper is more useful to Americans than economy strategists. When Intelligence Officer, Edward Snowden exposed the scandals of American democracy, he knew he would not be safe in his country so do all good Americans.
