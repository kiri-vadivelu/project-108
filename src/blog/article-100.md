There is great relationship between churches, corporations and governments of all types. Under all conditions, they not go against each other. Either they stand together or remain silent to support each other. All three are perfectly united evil friends who make sure masses are controlled in a way to protect the interest of the ruling class.

A food for thought. Have you ever wondered why churches care about abortions but not death of workers on the job? I have never seen a church protester holding a sign saying "Kill a Worker, Go to Jail" even though that happens every year in Canada.

Churches in capitalist society exist to reinforce the believe that the nastiest of men for the nastiest of motives will somehow work for the benefit of all.
