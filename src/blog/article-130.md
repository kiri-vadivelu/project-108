Year after year, we remember the sacrifices made by Canadian heroes on the 11th day of November. But the next day, we move on with our daily business without any follow up actions. Our heroes would not have entered the battlefield should they knew the war will never end one day. Sadly, 100 years passed, we are still in the same page. Then, how do we turn the pages of the history? A poem to reflect.

We are yet to ask,
who our enemy is.

From the river to the sea,
Palestine will be free.
From north to the south,
Eelam people will be free.

We are yet to ask,
who our enemy is.

They take our bread,
give us bread crumbs.
They take our land,
rent us living spaces.
They take our wealth,
pay us less than peanuts.

We are yet to ask,
who our enemy is.

From the river to the sea,
Palestine will be free.
From north to the south,
Eelam people will be free.

They take our lives,
give us war hero metals.
They tell us otherwise,
enemy will kills us.
We are dying for them,
but they are fooling us.

We are yet to ask,
who our enemy is.

They are telling us,
we are lucky to be alive.
They want even more from us
but we are broken pieces.
We scream enough is enough,
but our voices are muted.

We are yet to ask,
who our enemy is.

_Dedicated to all war heroes and for future without war!_
