Year after year, we remember the sacrifices made by Canadian heroes on the 11th day of November. After few days, we move on with our daily lives without any follow up actions. Our heroes would not have entered Vimy Ridge should they knew the war will never end one day. Sadly, 100 years passed, we are still in the same page. Then, how do we turn the pages of the history? A poem to reflect.

We are yet to ask,
who our enemy is.

All mighty Canadians in 1917,
served the nation at the vimy ridge.
Fought the coldest battle to victory,
marched against the Nazi machine guns.

That tested even the toughest,
few days with many thousands.
Sacrificed all for our world pride,
how shall we forget them?

Those who came home to peace,
only to face the great depression.
Without any means to live in 1930,
fought again to rescue humanity.

We are yet to ask,
who our enemy is.

They take our bread,
give us bread crumbs.
They take our land,
rent us living spaces.
They take our wealth,
pay us less than peanuts.

We cry from river to the sea,
So the people can be free.
We rise from the north to south,
So the planet can breathe.

They are telling us that:
we are lucky to be alive,
and ignore the needs of planet.
Yet, they want even more,
but both are broken pieces.

We are yet to ask,
who our enemy is.

Know the fear and control,
avoid the divide and conquer.
Thus, where fascism thrives,
when the common sense dies.
All surplus value of service,
with poppies of Flanders Fields.

They take our lives for pride,
give us war hero metals to rest.
They tell us wars are necessary,
otherwise, enemy will kill us.

We are killing and dying in grace.
We are yet to ask, who our enemy is.
But they are fooling us lavishly,
choose death for peace over greed.

We are yet to ask,
who our enemy is.

_Dedicated to all war heroes and for future without war!_
