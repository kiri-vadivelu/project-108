"Where salary do not depend on not understanding reality or acceptance of comfortable narrative”. The Jamstack philosophy merged all the best tools to work together in harmony to make web space sustainable and manageable.

Jamstack is an architectural approach that decouples the web experience layer from data and business logic, improving flexibility, scalability, performance, and maintainability.

The Jamstack approach removes the need for business logic to dictate the web experience. It enables a composable architecture for the web where custom logic and 3rd party services are consumed through APIs.

So where do we go from here? Our ability to streamline the user experience, optimize the un-optimized and content creation would dictate the rest of the journey in the cloud space. Gladly, [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) is a good place to start.
