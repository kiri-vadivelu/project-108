Who votes in Toronto municipal elections? This landmark study identifies significant variations in voter turnout among eligible voters across the city’s 44 wards and 140 official neighbourhoods over the past three civic elections of 2003, 2006 and 2010. We are especially interested in identifying how an area’s proportion of immigrants, visible minorities, tenants and its median household income impacts voter turnout. We conclude that Toronto has a distinctly uneven geography and demography of municipal voting. An excerpt from MayTree Policy Research.
