In the age of capitalism, the birth and death passes in a blink of eye. We must embrace life before death or else we will die before we live without knowing the purpose of our lives. Greed will always be the barrier to peace and democracy but how we overcome the greed to experience life is a journey. A poem to reflect on the small spectrum of life.

Every life has a purpose in the planet earth<br>
But its survival depends on mercy of the greed<br>
Few control everything with pride and power

To be born into wealth is an ugly dream<br>
Life value is decided even before birth<br>
Greedy ones have started eating its flesh

Some wish to live forever, some not<br>
Some seeks to make life less sorrow<br>
Some surrendered to the predators

To share the space, to live in peace<br>
A luxury dream humans cannot afford<br>
Is it the greatest species of the planet?

Today, we reap what we saw yesterday<br>
What are we planting for tomorrow<br>
Other than war, violence and injustice.

Ignorance of many do not benefit any<br>
To end death race is the beginning of life<br>
Why not embrace life before death?
