The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is a money laundering organization that operates since 1945. Although, IMF was initially created to balance economic inequality and reduce poverty, the organization achieved neither of any. Today, IMF transitioned into a powerful organization to topple any national government financially.

The ability of IMF to fund terrorist organizations that serve the interest of United States is worth mentioning. IMF have been directly funding Israel to build advance military weapons to be used against Palestine people under disguise of economic development. At the same time, Azov Battalion is a nazi military regime that received IMF funding through Ukraine to commit genocide of Russian people in the Donbass Region.

Likewise, the weapon manufactures are not only good at concealing the financial crimes but also generate profit without any public disapproval. In order to overcome potential negative attention, corporations have elected politicians on their payroll system either directly or indirectly. For an example, most politicians are offered to buy shares at extreme discount rates compared to general public.

The truth is real criminals are closer to us than we think. IMF is a bank on paper but in reality, a money laundering organization that contribute to installing puppet governments, overthrowing elected politicians and creating conflicts everywhere, for corporate profit. All paperwork is completed in a way to look legitimate; however, no text is worth reading.

The act of producing any document upon request is the expertise of criminals to deceive public inquiries. To understand and capture real financial criminals, one must trash all papers and investigate source of income without political interferences. Smart Zionists lie on the paper, poor Americans die in the field.
