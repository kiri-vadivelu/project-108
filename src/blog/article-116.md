My sadness is not in the outcome of the election but rather in the amount of eligible voters, nearly 70 percent who did not add their voice. It speaks to the condition of our society that have brutally let down by the ruling class; to benefit the few. However, I am more than optimistic with 10 percent of Scarborough who already placed trust in me by choosing socialism over capitalism and fascism.
