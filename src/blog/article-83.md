Of course, International courts headed by United States and the apartheid Israel did not have enough evidence to prove genocide or use of chemical weapons during the final phase of War in Sri Lanka. A classic conclusion of court case in a corporate capitalist society where money talks bullshit walks. Please exercise caution before viewing the images as they may be extremely disturbing to some.

After all, ruthless capitalist governments have no interest in human rights or international law, that is why history repeats. Justice will not matter in a society where profit is the first priority.

The Indian news channel 'News X' broadcast footage of a Sri Lankan army officer reportedly boasting of the use of chemical weapons against Tamil fighters and civilians during the final stages of the armed conflict in Sri Lanka.[Read More](https://www.tamilguardian.com/content/video-sri-lankan-soldier-describing-use-chemical-weapons-indias-news-x).
