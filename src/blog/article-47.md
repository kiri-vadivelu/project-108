According to War Statistics, America is the enemy of peace and prosperity everywhere. Those who live outside of United States knows more about America than actual Americans. When actor Will Smith slapped comedian Chris Rock on the stage, Americans debated while non Americans laughed and confirmed the truth about American culture. While Americans wave the flag and believe America as the symbol of peace, rest of the world disgusted at the reminder of all crime against humanity committed by American military.

A common elementary schooler argument is that everyone wants to come to America because America is a free and peaceful country. In reality, foreigners are escaping from war and sanctions that are directly or indirectly linked to American weapon manufactures. The profit of war is like a Christmas to American politicians, military complex and banking investors but nightmare for everyone. People realize that only place to escape war consequence is coming into America and they do at means necessary.

United States is the only place where everything can be commodified and made profit from basic necessities to human rights everywhere. American people forgot what is like to live in peace since America started declaring wars to reboot the failing capitalist economy. Today, the friendship of United States and Europe built on the principle of world peace is the primary reason for war everywhere. The friendship is at stake so do humanity.
