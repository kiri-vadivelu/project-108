Most people are afraid to engage in difficult conversations. Because humans are driven to be at peace and harmony by default; not at conflict. That is a blessing and a curse at the same time.

An iron rod does not become knife without facing the heat nor a caterpillar can become a butterfly without accepting transition. It is ok to be wrong and it is ok to have misunderstanding but it is never ok to remain in comfort.

Most corporatists are not afraid to call the vulnerable people lazy but avoid difficult conversation themselves in fear of change. The people who pretend to care are the ones investing in military complex to kill unknown humans overseas.

Simple questions can help cut the chase, get to the point, be productive at workplaces and find real friends; who genuinely care about the wellbeing of humanity, planet and our community.

For instance, asking where do one stand on Israel Palestine Conflict and why; will save years of misunderstandings. Ability to think, reflect and change when necessary are key factors of real good company.

I was often asked as to why I support the people of Palestine. My simple answer is that I always stand in solidarity with the oppressed everywhere.
