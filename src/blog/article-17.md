Greed is an intense and selfish desire for something, particularly wealth, power or status. However, most people tend not to criticize the greed of another due to potential jealousy portrayals. Interestingly, jealousy is manageable but greed is not. For the purpose of simplicity, greed can be understood as excessive desire based on the context of survival necessity to co-exist within given society.

Today, colonial capitalism have produced mass amount of greedy leaders in variety of sectors. For instance, David McKay, president and CEO of Royal Bank of Canada alone earns 15 million in annual salary while $15/ hr is the minimum wage for Canadians. Ironically, David does not work that hard to justify the earning while most working Canadians do not have adequate to eat and pay rent at the same time.

Sadly, the excessive greed of David is glorified instead of being disgusted. The mainstream narrative is that hard working people can earn anything in a free society. The reality is that David is not working hard enough to earn 15 Million nor society is free for everyone. The social silence and complicit is what keeps David stealing through the crack while those who work hard mentally and physically are degraded.

Of course, David is not making decision directly to exploit the unskilled labour for his benefit; but, his job of pushing the button may be the real unskilled labour. Existence of glorified so called skilled labour titles ridicule those actually earn living through meaningful contribution to society. Clearly, David is greedy, likely have a questionable lifestyle where large amount of money is necessary.
