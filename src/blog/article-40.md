Based on the classification system, RULING CLASS does not benefit directly from the wars. However, ruling class require expressing the interest of the OWNER CLASS to remain in power. For instance, Deputy Prime minister of Canada, Chrystia Freeland attending Ukraine support rally to carry Ukraine-Nazi flag is an expression of owner class interest; instead of anti-poverty flag.

Although, true solution to the Ukraine Russia war is on the table, ruling class of all nations would advocate for war mongering efforts. For instance, sending weapons to conflict zone under the banner of peace and democracy to promote war is the perfect irony of all rather than de-escalation through peaceful resolutions. Casualties of all warfare are truth, environment and WORKING CLASS.
