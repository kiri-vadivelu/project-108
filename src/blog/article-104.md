When we ask, why most people dislike politics, the answer is pretty obvious. No one likes being lied or asked to believe a false reality. Therefore, working people shy away from politics; which reflects in the statistics that only a small percentage of eligible working people actually vote in local politics. If all the workers actually caste vote, status quo will change in a heartbeat, that is the great nightmare of ruling class.

Ruling political parties always act in the interest of the few; that is why minimum wage do not change, our living conditions do not improve but cost always rise. Ruling class is filled with greed and views working people as their enemy; that is why police are over funded for security while schools and hospitals are underfunded. The power hungry politicians use all fancy and buzz words to come to power but if you look closer, it is same old shit.
