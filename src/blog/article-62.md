At the same time, if one was to question the quality of narrative, that leads to social awkwardness; therefore, we are coerced to accept the argument in face value.

According to rich people, the secret is hard-work, gumption and can do positive mindset. In reality, individuals are born into wealth or merciless exploitation of the working class.

So, what should we do about it? We must reject the false narrative. When we passively accept the myth to avoid social discomfort, in return, that make us feel less contributing members and submit to the oppressing class of society.

The subconscious mind plays an important role in our health, happiness and outlook of life.
