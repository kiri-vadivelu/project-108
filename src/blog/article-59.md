Hypocrisy is the practice of claiming to have higher standards or more noble believes than is the case. Simply put, a self serving false believe system of positive, negative and neutral positions. Often, hypocrisy goes unchallenged but closely associated with lies and rumours.

Due to constant exposure to hypocrisy in media and social situations that fit the narrative, most people tend to accept the hypocrisy as a way of life. Like junk food, individuals need to be intentional about rejecting hypocrisy in order to preserve sanity.

An example of positive hypocrisy is calling to free Ukraine while wanting to lockdown unvaccinated neighbours. Just because collective public safety out weighs the individual choice, that does not mean individual rights can be compromised.

An example of negative hypocrisy is calling to free Ukraine while justifying countless war crimes of United States. Just because war is evil in Ukraine does not mean war is good, acceptable or necessary elsewhere.

An example of neutral hypocrisy is supporting the individual right to un-vaccination while denying the right to abortion. Just because neutral hypocrisy is socially acceptable, that does not mean hypocrisy is not harmful to the wellbeing of all.

The ideal is to investigate the narratives and then to stand with the oppressed everywhere.
