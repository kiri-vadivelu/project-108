The enemy ‘Thug Ford’ is a viciously reactionary but erratic and incompetent regime headed by a blustering buffoon. This fight can serve as a beacon to workers and hard pressed communities to find hope, take courage and be part of a sweeping fight back. The demand to “Dump Thug Ford with A General Strike” is rising out of necessity.

Some key points that are worth considering in the fight for fair wages to education workers in Ontario against the rising cost of living are:

1. Ford is by default. In the last election, his party held onto power with the votes of only 18% of those eligible to cast ballots. He is far more the product of oppositional weakness than his own strength.

2. Their fight takes place in the context of a global cost of living crisis, an unfolding slump and a round of intensified austerity. It isn't an isolated skirmish but a decisive confrontation, the outcome of which will have much wider implications.

3. There exists on our side a much greater power than Ford can muster but it has to be unleashed. This comes down to a readiness to defy and an ability to mobilize.

4. The effort to slash real wages through the crudest form of legislated political thuggishness is creating shock and anger. If CUPE digs in and other unions act as the situation demands a great deal is possible.
