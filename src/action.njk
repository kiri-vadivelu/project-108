<h2>Examine the Program to Identify Priorities</h2>
<ul class="cards">
  <li>
    <h3>De-fund the Police</h3>
    <span
      >In midst of covid lock down, Toronto police evicted houseless people from
      public parks using state funded violence and injured public members who
      came to defend the vulnerable from police brutality
      <a

        ><strong>&#10140;</strong>
      </a></span
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Fund Our Schools</h3>
    <span>
      Evidently, children who eat breakfast tend to do well in school but many
      working families cannot afford meal due to artificially small take home
      pay. City shall fill the gap with provincial funds
      <a
        href="https://github.com/kiri-vadivelu/project-108/blob/main/src/assets/docs/peoples-platform.pdf"
        ><strong>&#10140;</strong>
      </a>
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Make Transit Free</h3>
    <span>
      Students shall never have to decide between bus fare and lunch in a
      wealthiest city. Criminalizing poverty through expensive fare enforcement
      do not facilitate positive tourist experience
      <a
        href="https://github.com/kiri-vadivelu/project-108/blob/main/src/assets/docs/peoples-platform.pdf"
        ><strong>&#10140;</strong>
      </a>
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Expropriate Giant Landlords</h3>
    <span>
      Housing is not a private commodity. Developers do not build housing for
      people but create wealth for shareholders using tax dollar benefits. But,
      housing is a human right
      <a
        href="https://github.com/kiri-vadivelu/project-108/blob/main/src/assets/docs/peoples-platform.pdf"
        ><strong>&#10140;</strong>
      </a></span
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Wealth Inequality Tax</h3>
    <span
      >Since 1970, profit of big corporations have been sky rocketing while
      working people earn less with inflation and pay more on tax. End corporate
      welfare state
      <a
        href="https://github.com/kiri-vadivelu/project-108/blob/main/src/assets/docs/peoples-platform.pdf"
        ><strong>&#10140;</strong>
      </a>
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>End Service Discrimination</h3>

    <span>
      Banking is an essential service; however, bank discriminates poor people
      by default with higher fees, e.g NSF fees. Likewise, insurance companies
      assess risk using postal code
      <a

<h1>Lead the Social, Economical and Political Innovation</h1>
<p>
  We all know, something have to change. We do not know where to start. Our
  grass-root movement is made up of people who genuinely care about our city.
  There is a place for you to <strong>contribute</strong> and become an active
  <strong>leader</strong> in your <strong>neighborhood</strong>. Thats the
  beauty of Municipal Socialist Alliance (MSA), all inclusive from the bottom
  up.
</p>

<p>
  <q>Show me your program, I' ll tell your priorities</q

</p>

<p>
  Establishment sponsored elections and endorsed candidates come and go but MSA
  is always active in our local communities. MSA believe that change do not come
  from outside but within us and by our actions. In a social condition where
  people die on the streets without adequate care,
  <strong>non-partisan means pro-establishment.</strong>
