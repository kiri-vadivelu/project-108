  <h1><strong> Kiri Vadivelu </strong>| <i>For Mayor of Toronto</i></h1>
  <p>
    My name is Kiri Vadivelu and I am running to be the next mayor of Toronto. I
    am a social justice activist and a member of the Municipal Socialist
    Alliance which ran 10 candidates across southern Ontario last October,
    receiving about 15,000 votes. I was the MSA candidate in Scarborough Centre
    Ward 21 gaining 1,800 votes. I am the first Tamil-Canadian to seek the
    mayor’s office in Toronto.
  </p>

  <p>
    I immigrated from Sri Lanka as a child, and successfully resisted illegal
    eviction of my family at the Ontario Landlord and Tenant Board during the
    2020 emergency lock down. I believe good housing is a human right. I am a
    founding member of the Scarborough Tenants’ Union, a leading voice of
    Toronto ACORN, and a committed member of Justice for Workers. I was a shop
    steward in the United Steelworkers Union where I fought for better working
    conditions, and was the recipient of a 2019 union leadership award.
  </p>

  <p>
    Toronto is in crisis, the product of a failed capitalist system. Only
    socialist measures offer solutions. The MSA and I call for immediate mass
    social housing construction,
    <strong>expropriation of giant landlords</strong>, and
    <strong>free public transit</strong> . We seek to
    <strong>repair our schools</strong>, and
    <strong>cut police budget</strong> by at least 50%. We demand a climate
    justice agenda, replacement of the "strong mayor" powers with a
    <strong>grassroots participatory budget </strong>process, and steep taxation
    of the properties of big business and the rich.
  </p>

  <p>
    Premier Doug Ford says don’t vote for anyone who wants to cut the police
    budget. We say: Don’t vote for anyone who voted for the police budget. Let’s
    build community power, working class power, from the bottom up.
    <strong>Organize and fight.</strong> Vote socialist. Elect
    <strong>Kiri Vadivelu for Mayor of Toronto</strong> on June 26!
