  <h3 class="text-center">Socialist Reflection of Toronto Election</h3>
  <p>
    Thank you for your conscious decision to endorse a socialist for mayor of
    Toronto. I am truly proud of my campaign team and everyone who braved the
    moody wet weather to cast the ballot.
  </p>
  <p>
    You have invested your vote to bring the change you want to see in our
    community. You chose to lit the candle than to curse the darkness. Hence, I
    am hopeful that socialism will prevail. People united can never be defeated.
  </p>
  <p>
    Corporate media has won itself a status quo candidate Olivia Chow to
    maintain the crumbling capitalist system by invoking fear in the minds of
    workers as oppose to a free choice. Now, revolutionary Toronto needs us more
    than ever.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nothing to brag after finishing 29th out of 102 candidates but I find
    shelter in hope for democracy. I enjoyed marching in our streets for
    justice, I enjoyed decorating our landscape with socialist posters and I
    enjoyed folding our flag at the end of the day.
  </p>
  <p>
    I know, our victory is work in progress. Thanks to Scarborough Tenants
    Union, Workers Action Movement, Peopleâ€™s Strike, Greater Toronto for BDS,
    Socialist Action, Municipal Socialist Alliance and to all those endorsed,
    volunteered and stood in solidarity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let us continue to inspire everyone for positive transformation of our
    society from hostile capitalism to worker friendly socialism. Gladly, public
    office is not a requirement to mobilize our community for economic
    democracy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Comradely,<br />
