  <h3>
    ZIONISM IS NAZI-LIKE RACISM. THE POGROM SLAUGHTER AGAINST PALESTINE MUST
    END!
  </h3>
  <p>
    The US/Israeli fascist pogrom to further subjugate and displace the
    determined Palestinian people from their homeland is actively taking place.
    The 1948 Nakba is alive once again! Gaza and the West Bank are bleeding
    nonstop under mass army terror. Over 40,000 people are dead or seriously
    injured. People are being butchered, chased out of their homes, they cannot
    worship in peace, they have no bread, food, drinking water, or basic
    necessities and cannot even bury their dead, while roads and public hospital
    facilities are being destroyed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The glee on the faces of the imperialists and their racist troops executing
    this brutal pogrom, is a clear indication of the concerted attempts by
    Israel to use murderous violence to keep the Palestinian nation and people
    colonized and to use them in a slave like fashion. Zionism not only
    exhibiting its racist qualities but showing that it has learnt well from its
    Nazi oppressors of the past.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are witnessing the horror which comes about from the American, European,
    and Canadian colonialists arming of this beast-like regime in Tel Aviv, with
    the weapons to conduct mass slaughter.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now that Zionism has gone out of control in a vivid, practical and murderous
    manner the world can see that they never had any intention, since 1948, to
    share the land of Palestine nor to allow the ancestral people of the land to
    exist as a nation or to let freedom reign from the river to the sea.
  </p>
  <p>
    What we are seeing is the raw power of a European settler colonial apologist
    project, armed to the teeth, taking measures to get its own way, not only in
    Palestine, but also in the whole region. This is an old-style vagabond
    capitalist project gone mad, in its efforts to subjugate a defiant people
    and capture their resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    The people of the world never intended for the Zionists to take over and
    establish a racist apartheid state inside Palestine without regards to the
    rights or needs of the Palestinian people and nation. For 75 years the
    Palestinian people in Gaza, the West Bank and in their refugee camps, have
    resisted all attempts to enslave them and have fought for their right to
    self determination. These latest concerted attempts to wipe out the just
    aspirations of the Palestinian people will never succeed. The outcome of
    this invasion of Gaza and the West Bank will not determine the faith of the
    Palestinian people. They are bound to continue their resistance in one form
    or another until victory!
  </p>
  <p>
    I stands with the Palestinian people in this fight for their very lives and
    for their existence as a nation with the right to determine their own
    destiny and to decide who governs their land and resources. My support is
    unconditional.
  </p>

  <p>
    I denounce the actions of the American imperial state and its NATO allies in
    arming and executing this murderous phase of its colonial project to
    subjugate Palestine. It is equally shameful that the Canadian government is
    not missing a beat in its backing of the Zionist fascist regime in carrying
    through this pogrom against the Palestinian nation and people. The
    Palestinian nation and people's freedom from Zionist Settler Colonial rule
    is our freedom as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    I call on all Torontonians to continue to come out in support of the
    struggle of the determined Palestinian people to overcome the ravages of
    Zionist settler colonialism and its backers worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>PALESTINE WILL BE FREE!!!</p>
