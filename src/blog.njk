<h3>Land Acknowledgement for Scarborough</h3>
<p>
  The land I am standing on today is the traditional territory of many nations
  including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the
  Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples and is now home to many diverse First
  Nations, Inuit and MeÃÅtis peoples. I also acknowledge that Toronto is covered
  by Treaty 13 signed with the Mississaugas of the Credit, and the Williams
  Treaties signed with multiple Mississaugas and Chippewa bands.
</p>

<p>
  Using and participating in a land acknowledgement is a way to recognize the
  enduring presence and resilience of Indigenous peoples in this area for time
  immemorial. They are also a reminder that we are all accountable to these
  relationships. I dedicate all of my journal entries to my daughter Katherine
  and every child that never returned home from residential schools in Canada
  through 1830 to 1996.
</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, I am grateful for your interest to learn more about my experiences
  socially, economically and politically in the oppressed age of times. By
  visiting the blog, you agree to respect Scarborough land acknowledgement and
  access all of its content in the same spirit.
