# The Rational for Change

As we slowly come out of the long [pandemic](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html), Toronto still have no plans in place to address the needs of working, young
and the [vulnerable](https://www.homelesshub.ca/resource/opportunity-knocks-prioritizing-canadaâ€™s-most-vulnerable-youth)
in the city. Our wages shrink, expenses skyrocket and we line up food bank but that is
not a concern for [status quo](https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/the-return-of-fascism) politicians. That is why I stand.

From
[Lamport Stadium](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/lamport-stadium-encampment-homelessness-toronto-1.6110697) to Parliament Hill, our liberty and justice have been compromised like never before in history. City of Toronto elegantly criminalized poverty through [evicting](https://www.cp24.com/news/video-shows-police-storming-toronto-apartment-during-single-dad-s-eviction-1.5377907?cache=ifpvdgct) houseless people from public parks while Ottawa struck peaceful [protesters](https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/ontario-police-watchdog-investigating-use-of-horses-non-lethal-rounds-at-ottawa-protest-clearing-1.5788915) with iron fist for resisting vaccine mandates. COVID 2020 reminded that status quo cannot and will not address the needs of our community but we can ourselves. That is why I stand.

We, as individuals may have different opinions and views on many things;
however, we are the 99 percent and share the common goals. The 1 percent who
[owns](https://globalnews.ca/news/7950579/developer-buy-1-billion-homes-canada-housing-market/) everything, do not even live in our city continue to dictate the politics in our city hall. The tyranny, hate and division must stop for the good of all of us. Like the majority, my faith in our [electoral](https://www.ourcommons.ca/content/Committee/421/ERRE/Brief/BR8550163/br-external/McCullochStephen-e.pdf) system is low since that only works for the few. It reveals the fact that our democracy have been exploited by the [corporate](https://acorncanada.org/news/blogto-all-toronto-city-council-alleged-have-accepted-donations-developers/)
capitalists for long time. Sadly, the status quo leaders are corporate welfare
bums rotating their turns. Therefore, I decided to run for city council in
October 2022 to address the needs of 99 percent of us.

I truly believe that only grassroots movements lead by collective actions can
restore democracy, peace and [justice](https://www.justice4workers.org) for all. For those
reasons, I will be knocking on doors, dropping flyers and or meeting people
across the city. Please remember to add your voice. Together, we can change
the culture at city hall from oppression and exploitation to true [democracy](https://www.democracyatwork.info) and representation. That is why I stand.

Let us vote on October 24, say no to status quo. Unseat the greed, restore
justice and prosper socially and economically in harmony with
[nature](https://ecojustice.ca). Thats how we build a [sustainable](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/) future for our children and make Toronto a world class city.
