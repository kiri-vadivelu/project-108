  As we slowly come out of the long

  >, Toronto still have no plans in place to address the needs of working, young
  and the

  in the city. Our wages shrink, expenses skyrocket and we eat less but that is
  not a concern for
  <a href="https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/the-return-of-fascism"
    >status quo</a

  politicians. That is why I stand.

  with iron fist for resisting vaccine mandates. COVID 2020 reminded that status
  quo cannot and will not address the needs of our community but we can
  ourselves. That is why I stand.

  We, as individuals may have different opinions and views on many things;
  however, we are the 99 percent and share the common goals. The 1 percent who

  >
  everything, do not even live in our city continue to dictate the politics in
  our city hall. The tyranny, hate and division must stop for the good of all of
  us. Like the majority, my faith in our

  system is low since that only works for the few. It reveals the fact that our
  democracy have been exploited by the
  <a
    href="https://acorncanada.org/news/blogto-all-toronto-city-council-alleged-have-accepted-donations-developers/"
    >corporate</a
  >
  capitalists for long time. Sadly, the status quo leaders are corporate welfare
  bums rotating their turns. Therefore, I decided to run for city council in
  October 2022 to address the needs of 99 percent of us.
</p>

<p>
  I truly believe that only grassroots movements lead by collective actions can
  restore democracy, peace and
  <a href="https://www.justice4workers.org">justice</a> for all. For those
  reasons, I will be knocking on doors, dropping flyers and or meeting people
  across the city. Please remember to add your voice. Together, we can change
  the culture at city hall from oppression and exploitation to true
  <a href="https://www.democracyatwork.info">democracy</a>
  and representation. That is why I stand.
</p>

<p>
  Let us vote on October 24, say no to status quo. Unseat the greed, restore
  justice and prosper socially and economically in harmony with
  <a href="https://ecojustice.ca">nature</a>. Thats how we build a
  <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/"
    >sustainable</a

  future for our children and make Toronto a world class city.
