Whether it is a blessing or curse, we are only wired to think one dimensionally. However, the universe we live today is multidimensional. According to Darwin’s theory of evolution, human survival depends on the ability to adapt. The adaptation as an individual and group includes but not limited to social, economical and political spaces.

Although, humans have adapted well over the course of history to survive as individuals; we have failed miserably, collectively. That leads to ask the question of "Why do all good things come to an end?". Our one dimensional thinking prevented us from becoming the butterfly so we continue to remain as warm inside the shell. We can only grow as group if we embrace de-growth as individuals.

As soon as the differences rise, groups are at competition with each other instead of choosing to cooperate, share and protect the resources in the given space. To end all wars and to live in peace, we must act responsibly. We as individuals have outgrown to achieve the greatest heights in the universe; however, collectively as a group, the growth have not exceeded beyond tribes.

Thereby, capitalism of all types reap it saw as colonialism, imperialism and militarism. The never ending one dimensional path to destruction, injustice and unhappiness. Gracefully in 21st century, not all are mandated to participate in the misery. We can opt out of the race to destruction by embracing de-growth principles.
