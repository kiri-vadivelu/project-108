### Five Pillars of MSA

<br>
<details open>
<summary>Direct Democracy</summary>
Any individual or organization who agrees with our founding principles is
welcome to join the MSA. We seek to engage communities directly in
formulating demands, program, policy, and tactics.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Public Education</summary>
The struggle to radically transform society requires widespread education on
the failures of capitalism, imperialism, and colonialism to meet human needs
and on the necessity for a government led by workers and oppressed people.
To this end, we commit to holding public forums and town hall meetings to
amplify the voices of organizers leading the struggle against oppression and
exploitation.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Direct Action</summary>
Transformation of society cannot be achieved solely through parliamentary
means. History shows that all significant advances in human liberation are
won through the mass mobilization of people. The MSA recognizes the blockade
of roads and infrastructure as an important form of democracy. Founding
members of the MSA regularly participate in and organize direct action to
advance our demands, and we do not plan to stop!
</details>
<details>
<summary>Mutual Aid</summary>
The pandemic highlighted once again the human tendency towards mutual
assistance. While the city repeatedly failed to keep its inhabitants safe,
and police brutalized the most vulnerable amongst us, we stepped up. We keep
us safe! The MSA will organize mutual aid, not because it cannot succeed in
meeting all unmet needs, but because we strive to elevate our ability to
keep our communities safe into political power.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Program and Policy</summary>
The transformable vision we advance for the people living in our city needs
to be made clear in program and policy. The crystallization of our general
demands into a concrete plan will show that socialism not only better meets
the needs of people but in many cases, will cost workers and oppressed
people less. What we need to do, to begin, is to get rid of the food
scalpers, housing profiteers, and parasitic oligarchs!

### Add Your Voice

There are many ways you can contribute to win democracy at city hall. Here
are few. Make this election a priority event to help your family, friends
and neighbors to exercise democratic rights. Save the date, election day on
Monday, October 24, 2022.

1. Get the word out

2. Volunteer if you can

3. Of course, Vote

Regardless of ability, every little effort is sure to benefit all and make
you proud. Please do not hesitate to contact. I am only an email away.

Note that I did not ask for donation. I live amongst the hardest working
community earning the lowest salary. It would be unfair for me to ask for
donation from my community members who have nothing left at the end of the month. I would rather have them spend the hard earned dollars on them, their families and into our local businesses instead of my political campaign. That being said, if you have the means to support me financially, please do. I would greatly appreciate that.

### Get in Touch

Due to political campaign, IT profession and 15 months old baby, I have less
down time than the past. I may take longer than usual to respond to
inquires. I kindly ask for your patience and understanding.

In addition, my primary campaign is word of mouth and direct reach with
members of my community through door knocking, signing petitions and in
person conversations. It would be impossible to meet 120, 000 people in my
ward and get to know all of them before Oct 24 even though I would love to.
However, I am grateful to be living in the privileged time to
communicate with everyone at least digitally.

Please also note that I do not have any corporate funding to conduct large
campaign so I count your support to change the status quo. I am confident
that my platform does not require any convincing because it is people's
platform created by the people in the city just like you and me. See the [Program](https://github.com/kiri-vadivelu/project-108/blob/main/src/assets/docs/peoples-platform.pdf).
