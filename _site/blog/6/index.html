<h1>Journals</h1>
<p>
  I am grateful for your interest to learn more about my experiences socially,
  economically and politically, in the oppressed age of times. By visiting the
  blog, you agree to respect Scarborough land acknowledgement and access all of
  its content in the same spirit. Learn more about

<h3>Land Acknowledgement</h3>
<p>
  The land I am standing on today is the traditional territory of many nations
  including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the
  Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples and is now home to many diverse First
  Nations, Inuit and MeÃÅtis peoples. I also acknowledge that Toronto is covered
  by Treaty 13 signed with the Mississaugas of the Credit, and the Williams
  Treaties signed with multiple Mississaugas and Chippewa bands.
</p>

<p>
  Using and participating in a land acknowledgement is a way to recognize the
  enduring presence and resilience of Indigenous peoples in this area for time
  immemorial. They are also a reminder that we are all accountable to these
  relationships. I dedicate all of my journal entries to my daughter Katherine
  and every child that never returned home from residential schools in Canada
  through 1830 to 1996.

        <a href="/blog/article-27/">Are You still Paying Taxes?</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
The ancient voluntary taxation system was created to ensure all people have access to food, medicine and basic humanitarian needs. However, the corrupted kings used the tax dollars to organize military, protect monarchy and build tools to kill people. When people realized the misuse of hard earned dollars; people refused to pay taxes. What rational mind would pay money to kill innocent people?

      </h2>
      <p>
The special vocabulary, greenwashing and greenscamming are reserved for corporations that acknowledge the importance of environment preservation, yet, continue to cultivate the predatory culture for profit. Big corporations have adequate financial resources at disposal to create bogus jobs in order to skim more public tax dollars from government.

      </h2>
      <p>
The war mongering European Nations (EU) have been providing significant humanitarian aids but all come at significant cost under the carpet. All of the sentiment to support Ukraine is successfully rewarding the pockets of bankers in Europe and North America. Across the world, the voice to support Ukraine is genuine; however, financial industries have not waved any interest payment that could be used to support the people in crisis. World sympathy, particularly American sympathy is going to be too expensive for Ukraine people to bear in the aftermaths of war.

        <a href="/blog/article-50/">What is Real Challenge in Democracy?</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
Elections in capitalist countries always risk that the majority employees will vote to end the income and wealth inequalities produced by capitalism. So capitalists buy parties, politicians, mass media, etc. It‚Äôs their self defense against real democracy. Memorize the line and repeat every time when the alarm clock goes.

        <a href="/blog/article-25/">Contribution of Jeffrey Epstein to Philanthropy</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
One primary reason American people are blind to injustice everywhere is because no one invaded America over a century. Instead of building relationship, American elites have been burning bridges internationally. Only way to have friendship with the elites of United States is to participate to commit crime against humanity such as philanthropy work; best defined as private pedophile projects (P3).

      <h2>
        <a href="/blog/article-49/">Hidden Truth About Financial Investment</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
As revolutionary economist and German philosopher , Karl Marxist is a harsh critique of capitalist economic system. As a humanitarian, he felt that the capitalist system is unsustainable model, cruel to humanity and evil that thrives on the organized violence against people. He advocated for better society that would preserve economy, humanity and planet; though his vision was never fully implemented in practice due to variety of conflicts. His prominent work ‚ÄúThe Communist Manifesto‚Äù was even inspired his opponents to create ‚ÄúThe Capitalist Manifesto‚Äù a copycat version.

      </h2>
      <p>
Every empire in the history fought wars to steal but America has perfected the art of boosting the economy through war, consistently. For the credit of war driven economy, American corporations have looted the planet for profit because war is a profitable business. In order for the America to operate without loosing credibility, Hollywood maintained the status quo culture of violence through feeding lies to Americans and to those fans of American violence.

      </h2>
      <p>
‚ÄúThere were two kinds of slaves, the house Negro and the field Negro. The house Negroes--they lived in the house with master, they dressed pretty good, they ate good because they ate his food--what he left. They lived in the attic or the basement, but still they lived near their master; and they loved their master more than their master loved himself. They would give their life to save their master&#39;s house--quicker than the master would. If the master said, &quot;We got a good house here,&quot; the house Negro would say, &quot;Yeah, we got a good house here.&quot; Whenever the master said &quot;we,&quot; he said &quot;we.&quot; That&#39;s how you can tell a house Negro.

      </h2>
      <p>
As the COVID emergency slammed the brake on the world economy, a radical action was forced to protect the people. Unexpectedly, the impact of pandemic death toll driven lock downs coerced even the capitalist countries to roll out emergency assistance. Without a choice, Canadian liberal government rolled out temporary $2000 paycheque for all Canadians. The program made Liberal government to appear as the most radical left humanitarian government; but, the reality is the opposite.
