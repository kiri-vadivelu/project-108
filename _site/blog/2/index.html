        <a href="/blog/article-102/">Pandemic CEOs and Fake Guru Market</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
Regardless of political standing, we can all agree that pandemic have exposed many issues in our society. One the core issue was unjust wages that resulted in people earning less and losing more through the pandemic; meanwhile, those at the top get richer. The status quo argument was that CEOs earn their salary but poor workers are not. The conversation took a 360 turn after pandemic where front line workers were working the hardest under dangerous conditions while CEOs were watching Netflix.

      </h2>
      <p>
Despite previous assurances that it would not result in additional costs, a new report says the TTC will spend millions of dollars more on fare collection each year by using the Presto smartcard instead of tickets, tokens and passes. Skeleton in the closet is the breach of privacy and violent enforcement of the broken fare system. An excerpt from Toronto Star.

        <a href="/blog/article-106/">Inflation Gimmick in Status Quo Politics</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
Instead of throwing around fancy terms, we must stop and define all the buzz words. What is inflation? where does it begin? Is it caused by nature? Who wins and who loses? Answering the four questions would set one on the right path to realize inflation is just an economical gimmick to justify the status quo. The buzz word inflation is political forgery to protect the ruling class.

      </h2>
      <p>
The Canadian Museum for Human Rights recognizes that the colonial experience in Canada, from first contact to the present, constitutes genocide against Indigenous peoples. The Indian residential school system was one key component of this genocide.

        <a href="/blog/article-94/">Key Facts About Residential Schools</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
Residential schools were government-sponsored religious schools that were established to assimilate Indigenous children into Euro-Canadian culture. Although the first residential facilities were established in New France, the term usually refers to schools established after 1880. Residential schools were created by Christian churches and the Canadian government as an attempt to both educate and convert Indigenous youth and to assimilate them into Canadian society. However, the schools disrupted lives and communities, causing long-term problems among Indigenous peoples. The last residential school closed in 1996. An excerpt from The Canadian Encyclopedia.

        <a href="/blog/article-105/">Brand Politics Legitimize Dictatorship</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
In Canada, we have four mainstream political parties but only two ruled almost the entire time. The red liberal lies and the blue conservative crooks. Although both parties appears to have difficult political platform, in reality, both are just the same with altered words. If we analyze the decisions of each party historically, we would be shocked to know that both parties are just the same brand packaged under different names. Sadly, Obama dropped more bombs, killed more people and replaced legitimate leaders in third world countries than than Trump did.

        <a href="/blog/article-90/">Green-washing While Earth on Fire</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
Big corporations from oil to tech continue to green wash the economy for the purpose of more tax dollar extraction. We see that everyday on the television but somehow we are customized to accept the gimmick as real solution. Real solution include raising the standards of living for the people but that would upset the profit margins so green washing the way to go.

        <a href="/blog/article-103/">Inflation Crisis or Economical Scam?</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
COVID indicates that inflation is a not a natural cause but a planned economic disaster to make the rich get rich while poor get poor. Instead of being complicit, there are solutions to the problem that status quo leaders do not want people to know. The pandemic have transferred the wealth upwards and proved that the whole banking system is just a scam.

        <a href="/blog/article-86/">Why Do NDP Support Apartheid Crimes?</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
The Federal New Democratic Party (NDP) not only lost the mainstream elections in Canada since early 1990 but also lost its roots to serve the working people completely. Of course, corporate extremists eroded unions, labours and labour party but that is not an an excuse to tangle in internal politics to silence labour and human rights activists within the NDP. Sadly, NDP proved it has no interest in standing up for human rights inside or outside the borders through dropping an elected candidate in Vaughan.

        <a href="/blog/article-1/">Alternative to Pandemic-Era Housing Crisis</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
Whether a couple is planning to settle down or a family is seeking a place to raise kids in the province, they are sure to feel the heat in the Canadian housing market. The question: ‘How did we get here?’ often leads to inconclusive answers and simply pointing a finger at the easiest target. The predatory nature of housing market big players means they have no interest in addressing the needs of the people. For them, housing is a commodity designed to make shareholders happy. Actually, the housing market is doing very well to meet its mandates – funneling wealth upwards.
