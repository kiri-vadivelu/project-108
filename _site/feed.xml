Politics is often thought of as a complicated subject but its not. If we apply common sense instead of feelings, it would be crystal clear and simple to understand. Politics is a manipulative blame game of power and greed without responsibility in western society.

Most often, we strive to fight against the system that degrades humanity but at some point, we lose energy and motivation to fight. Thats the way our status quo system is designed so no change can happen from the grassroots. Working class people have no choice but to fight till the end or surrender to the status quo.

The housing is a crisis situation in Toronto. Average wait time to receive a rent geared to income housing in the big city is 10 years. Sadly, poverty does not wait that long but the status quo does not care. If one was to ask, why does things get worse year after year, the answer is simple. Those who represent the people have no interest in addressing the root cause of the problem such as poverty.

And that fills me with immense hope. Justice belongs in ALL spaces including LinkedIn regardless of what the status quo enforcers say.

Most people in Toronto are concerned about rising violent crimes in the city. Unfortunately, crime is not the sole responsibility of the police but collective responsibility of everyone in the city. As people of Scarborough, we can not only work toward eliminating crimes but make our communities safer for everyone. We just have to make the punishment fit the crime. The recipe is simple to execute but our status quo politicians will not do it. The ruling class is only interested in using crime as a weapon to further exploit working and the poor people of our city.

Whether a couple is planning to settle down or a family is seeking a place to raise kids in the province, they are sure to feel the heat in the Canadian housing market. The question: ‘How did we get here?’ often leads to inconclusive answers and simply pointing a finger at the easiest target. The predatory nature of housing market big players means they have no interest in addressing the needs of the people. For them, housing is a commodity designed to make shareholders happy. Actually, the housing market is doing very well to meet its mandates – funneling wealth upwards.

The Federal New Democratic Party (NDP) not only lost the mainstream elections in Canada since early 1990 but also lost its roots to serve the working people completely. Of course, corporate extremists eroded unions, labours and labour party but that is not an an excuse to tangle in internal politics to silence labour and human rights activists within the NDP. Sadly, NDP proved it has no interest in standing up for human rights inside or outside the borders through dropping an elected candidate in Vaughan.

Residential schools were government-sponsored religious schools that were established to assimilate Indigenous children into Euro-Canadian culture. Although the first residential facilities were established in New France, the term usually refers to schools established after 1880. Residential schools were created by Christian churches and the Canadian government as an attempt to both educate and convert Indigenous youth and to assimilate them into Canadian society. However, the schools disrupted lives and communities, causing long-term problems among Indigenous peoples. The last residential school closed in 1996. An excerpt from The Canadian Encyclopedia.

On Saturday, September 18, 2021, a small crowd rallied in Toronto at the Yonge and Dundas intersection calling for an end to discriminatory funding to ODSP and OW programs. POOF Protecting ODSP OW Funding is a community group striving to end Homelessness and Poverty for people on ODSP, Ontario Disability Support Program and OW, Ontario Works benefits. The event organizer, Isabella Gamk, said that people on ODSP and OW benefits are abandoned by all 3 levels of Canadian Government and left to fend for themselves with less than a livable income support. Sadly, the City of Toronto has no tangible plans to help marginalized people living on a poverty income.

There are many strategies to solve real problems rather than to let them persist. A primary method employed in politics is kicking the can down the road instead of reaching for the solution.

Who votes in Toronto municipal elections? This landmark study identifies significant variations in voter turnout among eligible voters across the city’s 44 wards and 140 official neighbourhoods over the past three civic elections of 2003, 2006 and 2010. We are especially interested in identifying how an area’s proportion of immigrants, visible minorities, tenants and its median household income impacts voter turnout. We conclude that Toronto has a distinctly uneven geography and demography of municipal voting. An excerpt from MayTree Policy Research.

They would give their life to save their master&#39;s house--quicker than the master would. If the master said, &quot;We got a good house here,&quot; the house Negro would say, &quot;Yeah, we got a good house here.&quot; Whenever the master said &quot;we,&quot; he said &quot;we.&quot; That&#39;s how you can tell a house Negro.

He advocated for better society that would preserve economy, humanity and planet; though his vision was never fully implemented in practice due to variety of conflicts. His prominent work “The Communist Manifesto” was even inspired his opponents to create “The Capitalist Manifesto” a copycat version.

One primary reason American people are blind to injustice everywhere is because no one invaded America over a century. Instead of building relationship, American elites have been burning bridges internationally. Only way to have friendship with the elites of United States is to participate to commit crime against humanity such as philanthropy work; best defined as private pedophile projects (P3).

So capitalists buy parties, politicians, mass media, etc. It’s their self defense against real democracy. Memorize the line and repeat every time when the alarm clock goes.

The war mongering European Nations (EU) have been providing significant humanitarian aids but all come at significant cost under the carpet. All of the sentiment to support Ukraine is successfully rewarding the pockets of bankers in Europe and North America. Across the world, the voice to support Ukraine is genuine; however, financial industries have not waved any interest payment that could be used to support the people in crisis. World sympathy, particularly American sympathy is going to be too expensive for Ukraine people to bear in the aftermaths of war.

In 1947, when the last colonizer British left Ceylon, they handed the power over to the majority of the country. The majority 85% were Sinhalese while less than 15% were Tamils. British favoured Tamils over the majority Sinhalese to lead the country for variety of reasons; however, abruptly left without any framework to run the country with 20 million people. During British occupation, Tamils enjoyed close connections to British administrations and were employed in high ranking roles. That embroiled bitter taste in the majority Sinhalese administrations. The ring wing Sinhalese majority seized power and began crushing the Tamil minority through all legal means to make Tamils secondary citizens.

No war is good except class war. However, we do not always get to hear the full story in the mainstream media. Our corporate media and elites have an agenda that undermine our democracy and wellbeing of everyone except rulers and corporates.

So if you fight your freedom in Ukraine, you are hero but if you do the same in Palestine, you are a terrorist. We need to find out who is setting the standards.

Before you reserve all your sympathy to children of Ukraine, please know that 67 innocent Palestinian children slaughtered by the Israeli bombing of Gaza last May, but no sanctions: nothing but a handshake. Clearly, they do not look like terrorists. Why are they not important?

The bankers will ensure we stay in debt. The pharmaceutical companies will ensure we stay sick. The weapons manufacturers will ensure we keep going to war. The media will ensure we are prevented from knowing the truth. The government will ensure all of this is done legally. Sad.

        <title>Ruling Class, Far Greater Threat</title>

There’s no gentle way to say it, but the truth is that a lot of us hate our elites far more than we hate some foreign dictator because ruling class is far greater threat to Canada and the United States than a foreign dictator.

Of course Canada is in the centre stage in the global media for unpleasant reasons. Most corporate media will do whatever necessary to amplify the freedom convey issues. Those who live outside the Canadian borders believe Canadian truckers are fighting for better employment, wages and benefits but we know that is far from reality.

The left and the right connect the dots. We can build back better but not this way. It is not democracy, equality or justice. Absolute fascism and plain dictatorship of political dissents. The famous line, &quot;We were just following the orders&quot;.

Life was not fair to workers even before the pandemic. We worked multiple jobs to feed and pay rent so few can get rich when food and shelter was a basic human need. As a frontline employee, I paid my dues while billionaires were going to space and laugh at us on their way back during the lock-down. Our capitalist leaders were protecting the big corporations while people were dying of disease that was manufactured through greed, ignorance and cruelty to humanity.

        <title>Zionist Devil Consume Palestine Lands</title>

The Palestine Israel conflict began since creation of Israel in the occupied land of Palestine. Zionist Israel used all evil means to divide humanity and control freedom of speech to achieve a false democracy. There is no freedom of speech or freedom to move for those who disapprove the genocide of Palestine people. People of Israel are victim of political propaganda to accept the genocide of Palestine while reject holocaust. If terrorization of Palestine people is justified, why so much outcry about gas chambers?

Sri Lanka’s government declared victory in May, 2009, in one of the world’s most intractable wars after a series of battles in which it killed the leader of the Tamil Tigers, who had been fighting to create a separate homeland for the country’s ethnic Tamil minority. The United Nations said the conflict had killed between 80,000 and 100,000 people in Sri Lanka since full-scale civil war broke out in 1983. The global failure to protect Tamil rights under International Law and the extraordinary silence of the Holocaust survivers must be questioned.

Under the scholarship of University of Toronto Professor Walter Kenyon, an Indigenous burial site dating to the 13th century was discovered. Excerpt from Scarborough Historical Society.

The Canadian containers arrived in the Philippines in 2013 and 2014 falsely labelled as being full of recycling plastics. Philippine customs authorities inspected the containers and discovered about two-thirds of them to be ordinary household garbage, including electronic waste and used diapers.

Of course, International courts headed by United States and the apartheid Israel did not have enough evidence to prove genocide or use of chemical weapons during the final phase of War in Sri Lanka. A classic conclusion of court case in a corporate capitalist society where money talks bullshit walks. Please exercise caution before viewing the images as they may be extremely disturbing to some.
